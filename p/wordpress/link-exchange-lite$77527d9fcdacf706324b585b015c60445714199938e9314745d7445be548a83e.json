You can review their proposal and accept it or reject it.\nAll you have to do is to send your link exchange form page to other webmasters if you are the one contacting them.\nOnce you approve a request, that site will be automatically posted on your site.\nUse the shortcode [link-exchange-form] where you want to show the request form.\nUse the shortcode [link-exchange-list] where you want to show the list of approved links.<\/p>",
