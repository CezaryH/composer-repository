This plugin makes the posts in the feeds (all feeds: rss,\nrss2, atom, rdf, etc) appear to be written anonymously, instead using the name of the site as the publishing author,\nrather than the name of the author.  This prevents admins from having to edit core files to make posts in the feed anonymous.<\/p>",
