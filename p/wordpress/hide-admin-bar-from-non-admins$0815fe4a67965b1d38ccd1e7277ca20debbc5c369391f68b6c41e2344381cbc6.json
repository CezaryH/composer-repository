Specifically the line <code>if(!current_user_can('administrator'))<\/code> determines who the admin bar is hidden for. Feel free to edit this to your needs. E.g. using<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>if(!current_user_can(&#039;edit_posts&#039;))<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>will allow authors to view the admin bar as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin has no settings and will not be updated often, so feel free to edit to your needs.<\/p>",
