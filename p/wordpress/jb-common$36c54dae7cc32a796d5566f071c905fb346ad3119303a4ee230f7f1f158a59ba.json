I've realized that when I create a \nnew WordPress project, there are some features I have to plugin every time. I \ndecided to bundle they all into a single plugin, and I'm publishing it for \nother creators who may find it useful too.<\/p>\n\n<p>Take a look to the <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/jb-common\/changelog\/\" title=\"Go to the Changelog section\">Changelog<\/a> \nfor a complete feature list, you may be interested in some of them.<\/p>",
