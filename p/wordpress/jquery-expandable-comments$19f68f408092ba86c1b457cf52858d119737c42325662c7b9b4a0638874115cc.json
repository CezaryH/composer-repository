An options page makes it really easy to change different parts of your comment calls.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n\n<p>This keeps the default \"<a href=\"http:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Function_Reference\/wp_list_comments\"><code>wp_list_comments()<\/code><\/a>\" features.  The only difference is that the child comments will have the added \"<code>&#60;div class='children'&#62;<\/code>\" added to it (ol and ul already have this class by default). A clickable span that triggers the action to expand the replies is also added.  Pagination and level depths are not affected.<\/p>\n\n<p>New features are including easing options, as well as allowing images. An options page has been added for further customizations, making it even easier to use.<\/p>",
