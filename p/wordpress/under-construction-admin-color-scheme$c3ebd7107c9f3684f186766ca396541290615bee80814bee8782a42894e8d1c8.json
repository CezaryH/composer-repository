                "description": "<p>Under Construction Admin Color Scheme is a visual throwback to the early days of the Web, when spirits were high, no-one used Internet Explorer, and those annoying \"Under Construction\" graphics were all over the place.<\/p>\n\n<p>With strong blacks, bright yellows and some eye-grabbing stripes, it's a macho color scheme for manly designers who need a visual reminder that their site isn't finished yet.<\/p>\n\n<p>Will it make you more productive? Probably not. But you'll have the comforting illusion that you're working heavy machinery with your bare hands, rather than growing old and pudgy under fluorescent light.<\/p>\n\n<p>The layout of the Admin panel is for the most part unaltered, save for a few pixels here and there. However the main editing area is centered and made wider (90% of screen width), just because I prefer it that way.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tested in Forefox 2 and IE7 (Win). This plugin requires Wordpress 2.5.<\/p>",
