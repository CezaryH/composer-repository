This means that the count is not based on clicks on the actual button (like other services out there) but on the actual share count in the whole of Google Buzz. So no matter how and where people share your links to Buzz they will be counted.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Real time count of buzzes<\/li>\n<li>Choose between four types of buttons - normal, small, simple, image (for feeds)<\/li>\n<li>Choose where to place button<\/li>\n<li>Choose on what pages button should be displayed<\/li>\n<li>Ability to add\/remove button only on specific posts<\/li>\n<\/ul>",
