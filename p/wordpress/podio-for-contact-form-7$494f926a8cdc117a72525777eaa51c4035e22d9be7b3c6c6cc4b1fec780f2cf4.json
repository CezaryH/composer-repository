Fields are matched by the contact form 7 field name and the external id in podio, any fields which go unmatched are sent to the notes field as to not loose any information.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is only made to work with Contact Form 7. Has been tested from 3.0.0 to 3.3.3.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please note that nothing will be sent to podio unless all your API details are filled in. Use the external id of a notes field to catch any fields that do not match between CF7 and Podio.<\/p>",
