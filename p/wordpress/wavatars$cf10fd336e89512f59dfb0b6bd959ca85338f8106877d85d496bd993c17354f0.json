The icons are based on email, \nso a given visitor will get the same icon each time they comment.  It livens up comment threads and gives people memorable \"faces\" to \naid in following conversations.  It's also fun.<\/p>\n\nFeatures:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Wavatars can generate 956,384 different shapes in 57,600 different color combinations for a total of 55,087,718,400 (55 billion)\nunique Wavatars.  Yeah, you should have plenty.  You'll run out of human beings (or hard drive space) long before you run out of \nWavatars.<\/li>\n\n<li>The icons are generated on-the-fly.  You can adjust the desired size of the icons.<\/li>\n\n<li>For easy deployment, icons will automatically precede the commenter's name.  You can set HTML to come directly before and after the\nicon (to put it inside of a &#60;DIV&#62; tag, for example) or you can control the placement of the icons manually if you don't mind adding \na single ",
