To indicate a stanza, wrap the appropriate text the [stanza]...[\/stanza] shortcode as follows:<\/p>\n\n<p>[stanza]\nIn Xanadu did Kubla Khan\nA stately pleasure-dome decree :\nWhere Alph, the sacred river, ran\nThrough caverns measureless to man\nDown to a sunless sea.\n[\/stanza]<\/p>\n\n<p>The amount of vertical distance between stanzas can be set on the Lineate settings page.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second shortcode is for indicating individual lines within a stanza. To ensure that each line in the above example was rendered correctly, you would use the [lineate] shortcode as follows:<\/p>\n\n<p>[stanza]\n[lineate]In Xanadu did Kubla Khan[\/lineate]\n[lineate]A stately pleasure-dome decree :[\/lineate]\n[lineate]Where Alph, the sacred river, ran[\/lineate]\n[lineate]Through caverns measureless to man[\/lineate]\n[lineate]Down to a sunless sea.[\/lineate]\n[\/stanza]<\/p>\n\n<p>A new butto",
