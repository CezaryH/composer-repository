Includes an optional widget.<\/p>\n\n<h4>How it Works<\/h4>\n\n<p>You upload a CSV file (from Excel or some other spreadsheet) containing your students' grades. One column in the spreadsheet contains student (or parent) email addresses. The plugin generates a random password for each email address (or you can use WP logins; see FAQ).
