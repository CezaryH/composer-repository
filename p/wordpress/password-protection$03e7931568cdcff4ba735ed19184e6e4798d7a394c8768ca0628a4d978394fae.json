Once you enable the plugin\nand enter a username and password ( please use a different username and password than your WordPress admin account ). Any user or bot that attempts to access wp-admin or your login page\nwill be required to successfully enter the additional authorization details before allowed access to the WordPress login page.  You can also set your login page to not allow direct access\nwithout a valid referrer header from your site. Please Note: No security plugin will provide 100% protection from hackers.  This plugin simply makes it harder for them to gain access using\nautomated techniques.  Please remember to ALWAYS KEEP UP TO DATE BACKUPS and use STRONG PASSWORDS!!<\/p>\n\n<p>PLEASE NOTE: Very Limited support will be offered for this plugin but it will be kept up to date and any bugs can be reported on the github page a",
