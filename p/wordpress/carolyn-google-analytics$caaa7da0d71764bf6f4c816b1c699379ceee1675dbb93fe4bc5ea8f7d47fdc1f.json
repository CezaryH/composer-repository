It has two features:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It stores the GA code as a site setting. This means no modifying theme files, which is especially useful in a Multisite context;<\/li>\n<li>The GA code is NOT inserted for logged-in users, meaning you won't run up your visitor counts as you administer your site;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>And that's it! It works with Google's \"Asynchronous\" tracking code, which goes in the page's head.<\/p>",
