You can add rel = \"author\" to your profile using this plug-in.<\/p>\n\n<p>Not only that. Some other html tags that may cause security problems are still blocked. So, you need not to worry using this plug-in like some other plugins out there.<\/p>\n\n<p>No configuration is required. Just install, activate and enjoy editing your author profile.<\/p>",
