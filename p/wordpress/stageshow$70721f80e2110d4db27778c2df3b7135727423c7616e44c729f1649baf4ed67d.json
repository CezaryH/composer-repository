PayPal IPN (Instant Payment Notification) is used to record sales and to collect buyer information.<\/p>\n\n<p>Each sale is fully recorded, with contact and payment details, tickets purchased and PayPal transaction number all saved to the Wordpress database. Confirmation emails, which can be customised as required, are sent to each purchaser and can be copied to the system administrator.<\/p>\n\n<p>EMails are in text only format, and the PayPal transaction number if included for validation purposes.  StageShow includes the facility on the admin pages to verify the transaction number for use at show time<\/p>\n\n<p>StageShow",
