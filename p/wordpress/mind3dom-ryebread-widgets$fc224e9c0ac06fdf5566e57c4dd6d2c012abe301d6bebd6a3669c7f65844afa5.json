AJAX is core-embedded.\nAfter writing your class, you must install it (this is done for the purpose of writing custom database data needed for widget functionality) in order to define widgets of this class.\nAfter defining widgets you can place them directly to your page using wordpress shortcodes or special plugin function.\nYou can specify skin (special markup) for each widget placement. You can also define containers (or sidebars) and place widgets into them.\nContainers are also placed on pages using shortcodes or function call.<\/p>",
