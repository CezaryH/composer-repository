I was disappointed that WordPress does not have anything built it to alert me with an email notification when a new author writes something. I don\ufffdt log into the sites unless I have to, so new content may sit for a while without being noticed. I did find 1 plugin that would accomplish the email, but it was buggy.

Now there are some additional settings, but check them out below.
