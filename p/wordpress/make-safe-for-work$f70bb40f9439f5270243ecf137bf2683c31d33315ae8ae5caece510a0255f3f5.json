Just wrap any offending\ncontent in [nsfw][\/nsfw] and your post will bypass even restrictive work filters.  Users\ncan then click a link that will reload the full uncensored version of the page.  By default,\ncensored text is padded to take up roughly the same amount of space as the original content.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first censored item in a post will be labeled \"[Not Safe for Work. Click to View.]\" and all\ncensored items after that will be labeled \"[NSFW]\" for brevity.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to force long or short forms instead of using long first and short after,\njust define MSFW_USE_FORM as either 'long' or 'short' in your functions.php like so:\ndefine('MSFW_USE_FORM','long');<\/p>\n\n<p>Using pad='false' you can disable padding of censored content:\n[nsfw pad='false']<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to default padding to off, just define MSFW_PADDING as fa",
