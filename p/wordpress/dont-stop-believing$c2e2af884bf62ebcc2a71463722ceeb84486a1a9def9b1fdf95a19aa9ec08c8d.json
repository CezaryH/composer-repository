The Rock Ballad is a helluva drug, and this plug-in reminds you the overwhelming power of song, mullets, and a particular tiny leopard-print yellow muscle tee. Let Journey's lyrics drown you with a deluge of 80's anthem awesomeness and send you awash in a sea of lighter-waving electrolytes.  Let us sing high and mighty, for our diaphragms should be pushed up into our lungs!   Inspired by the Hello, Dolly plug-in, when Don't Stop Believing is activated, you will see a line of lyrics from random Journey's classic hits in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.<\/p>",
