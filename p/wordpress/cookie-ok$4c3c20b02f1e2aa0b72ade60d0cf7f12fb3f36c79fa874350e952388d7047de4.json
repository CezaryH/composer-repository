In both cases, your site will become very user unfriendly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore, this plugin is designed to be less obtrusive than others. Visitors will see a small band above each page with a notice about cookies being used which they can accept, after which they will not see the notification any more. But even if they ignore the message, they will still be able to browse your site. Nobody will be blocked at any time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/silktide.com\/cookielaw\/resources\/video\">Videos by Silktide<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTES<\/strong><\/p>\n\n",
