This is accomplished with a combination of WordPress filter hooks and a little bit of JavaScript.<\/p>\n\n<p>After installation, visitors to the site will see email addresses and phone numbers \nas a fake email\/phone number;<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin is active in both the content section <em>and<\/em> the comments section: if a visitor inadvertently (or intentionally) posts a valid email address in a comment, it will be protected by this plugin as well.<\/p>",
