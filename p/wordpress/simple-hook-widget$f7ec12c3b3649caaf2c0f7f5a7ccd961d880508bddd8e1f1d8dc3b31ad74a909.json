Once the hook exists, your plugins, your theme, or the WordPress Core to make something happen with that hook.<\/p>\n\n<p>This can be used in conjunction with other more complex plugins, to allow you to trigger a hook from the sidebar (yes, that is intentionally vague). It can also serve as a quick alternative to making very simple widgets tied to code from a theme. Say you have a chunk of code which already exists on your site, you'd like to also have it placed in a sidebar, but don't want to make a widget out of it (since its entirely theme-centric). You could simply hook this chunk of code to a custom hook and use the Simple Hook Widget to place that custom hook in the sidebar.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is clearly not the best method of widget development, but there ",
