Because Gravity Forms does not use custom post types for its forms, this is not possible with both plugins out of the box. Simply select the gravity forms field type in the Option Tree settings and allow your clients (and yourself) to link to a form from Gravity Forms like you link to a post or page.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Translations<\/h4>\n\n<p>For websites in another language than English, the plugin has translation files included for the following languages:\n* Dutch<\/p>",
