It is ideal for Wordpress Blogs dedicated to cyclists, mountain bikers, runners, joggers, walkers, hikers, swimmers, canoeists, sailers, motorbikers and anyone else looking for routes, trails or tracks, on roads, paths, trails or even on water.<\/p>\n\nWP-Routes\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gpsies.com\/\">GPSies<\/a> is an interactive service that lets you view, print or download routes, tracks and trails. These routes are available on-screen for those researching new tracks, printable for those who want to take a paper copy with them or downloadable to a wide variety of devices for those a little more tech savvy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Routes are searchable by an interactive map and list details such as distance, elevation, route characteristics etc. It uses the GPSies API [http:\/\/www.gpsies.com\/api\/GPSiesAPI_en.pdf] and allows you to embed GPS maps direct into your wordpress blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>Based on an original idea by Flavio Alberti",
