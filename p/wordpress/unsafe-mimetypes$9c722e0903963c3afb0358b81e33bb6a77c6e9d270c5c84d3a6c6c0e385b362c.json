Users will often encounter the message 'Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons.'<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin allows the site admin to upload and distribute files other than the basic set WordPress allows by default.  This plugin allows the user to define a list of extensions they wish to allow.  Administrators can choose to allow only Administrators or all Media Uploaders to be able to add the defined types to the library.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: This plugin does not permit the user to change the maximum upload size, which may be needed for large multimedia files.<\/p>",
