You can use it to sign up users for \nseveral different lists by creating multiple instances of the widget. Once a user has subscribed, a cookie is stored on their machine to\nprevent the subscription form for that particular list from displaying. Subscriptions for other lists will display.<\/p>\n\n<p>The MailMan Widget:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>is easy to use<\/li>\n<li>is AJAX-enabled, but degrades gracefully if Javascript isn't turned on<\/li>\n<li>encourages the collection of only information that you actually need (i.e., an email address) to send your mailers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>If you find this plugin useful, please rate it and\/or make a donation.<\/p>",
