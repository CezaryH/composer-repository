Especially if you use some publishing platforms like WordPress, your blog WILL be spammed and no default methods will save you from such nightmare. This plugin utilizes the popular anti-spam library, reCAPTCHA, to help your blog stay clear of spams (especially when you integrate it with Akismet). Unlike the current WP-reCAPTCHA plugin, this one has a different approach and allows you to customize how the captcha looks using CSS.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Some Features<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hide reCAPTCHA for qualified visitors<\/li>\n<li>Choose how the plugin reacts when an answer is wrong or empty<\/li>\n<li>Choose between 4 default themes or create your own (sample CSS and images provided)<\/li>\n<li>Choose a language you prefer, possibility to add more language if needed<\/li>\n<li",
