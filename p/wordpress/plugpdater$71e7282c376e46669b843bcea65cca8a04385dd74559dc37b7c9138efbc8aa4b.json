Plugpdater eases this process by uploading the plugin in a temp directory, checking for errors, and if none were found replacing the old version by the new one.\nAs the plugin will write and replace files in \/wp-content\/uploads and \/wp-content\/plugins, make sure apache user has sufficient rights to do it.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Important : this plugin needs to be tested on a testing environment before using it on a production environment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>",
