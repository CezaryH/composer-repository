It also shows the number of Facebook Shares, and name and email address of the author, so that you can quickly get into contact with him or her. It also shows when last they commented on your blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>It takes some time for the data to load, so please be patient.<\/p>\n\n<p>I imagine that bloggers would use this to find out which other influential bloggers have recently been interested in their site, and then they'd be able to get into contact with them, saying something like:<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Hey John,<\/p>\n\n<p>I noticed that you posted a comment on my site the other day, and I just thought I'd send you a quick email to let you know that I like the content you've been posting. Perhaps we could write a guest post for each other sometime? I think that would suit both of our audiences well.<\/p>\n\n<p>Kind regards",
