This plugin imports the following data from Flickr:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Photos (full-size originals including EXIF data)<\/li>\n<li>Collections<\/li>\n<li>Sets<\/li>\n<li>Tags<\/li>\n<li>Comments<\/li>\n<li>Dates and times<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>It does not import notes, people, locations (geotags), or groups.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is highly recommended you run this importer with a Flickr Pro account. Without Flickr Pro you can only import your most recent 200 photos and will not be able to download your original photos.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin does not provide any features for displaying your photos and data. It is up to you to modify your theme to accomplish this. The <a href=\"http:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Gallery_Shortcode\">[gallery] short code<\/a> is another option.<\/p>",
