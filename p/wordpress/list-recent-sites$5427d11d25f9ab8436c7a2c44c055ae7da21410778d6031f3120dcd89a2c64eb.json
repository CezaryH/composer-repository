It lists blogname, description, admin, admin avatar, and recent posts. It should automatically excludes blog ID 1 (main blog), and post ID 1 (first \"Hello World\" posts of new blogs). I don't want any donations for this plugin but if you put a followable link ANYWHERE on your site to <a href=\"http:\/\/hackhut.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/hackhut.com<\/a> I would considered that payment. It is completely based on the hard work of Ron Rennick and a modified version of Sitewide Recent Posts for WordPress MU Andrea R. uses on her personal site. They deserve ALL credit for this, I only fixed some things and changed it a little here and there. You can get amazing work done by them at <a href=\"http:\/\/ronandandrea.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/ronandandrea.com\/<\/a> .<\/p>",
