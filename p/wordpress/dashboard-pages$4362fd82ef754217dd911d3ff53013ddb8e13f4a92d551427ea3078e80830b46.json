Rather than have a majority of the dashboard widgets focused on new blog posts and comments it puts the sites page listing front and center in the dashboard for easier and quicker content management.<\/p>\n\n<p>When using Wordpress as a content management system typically the first action after logging in is going to the \"edit pages\" item in the navigation. This is wasted effort and could be streamlined by including it on the dashboard for quicker and easier access.<\/p>",
