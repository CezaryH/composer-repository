It then automatically replaces the URL to each media file with their respective S3 URL or, if you have configured <a href=\"http:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/cloudfront\/\">Amazon CloudFront<\/a>, the respective CloudFront URL. Image thumbnails are also copied to S3 and delivered through S3\/CloudFront.<\/p>\n\n<p>Uploading files <em>directly<\/em> to your S3 account is not currently supported by this plugin. Also, if you're adding this plugin to a site that's been around for a while, your existing media files will not be copied or served from S3. Only newly uploaded files will be copied and served from S3.<\/p>\n\n<p>You'll also find a new icon next to the \"Add Media\" button when editing a post. This allows you to easily browse and manage files in S3.<\/p>\n\n<p>AWS for WP also provides an extra layer of security to your site against hackers\/bots by",
