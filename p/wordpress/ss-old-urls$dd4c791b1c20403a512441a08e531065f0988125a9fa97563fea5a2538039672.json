                "description": "<p>SS Old URLs allows you to add URL redirects through the WP admin for old content URLs.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, if your old site had its about page at \/about.html, but your new Wordpress site uses a nice URL like \/about\/, you can add the rule \/about.html ==&#62; \/about\/. This will preserve any existing links to the old URL. In addition, we perform our redirects as \"301\" redirects so you should maintain as much \"Google Juice\" as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is especially useful for developers and designers who are porting older websites to Wordpress. You can also use it if your move pages around or change URLs\/slugs for any reason.<\/p>",
