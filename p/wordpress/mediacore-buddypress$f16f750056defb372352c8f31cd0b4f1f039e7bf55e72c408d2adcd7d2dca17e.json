If the email address of the MediaCore publisher matches a Wordpress user, the activity is linked to the user.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin used to allow admins to import data from arbitrary RSS feeds into their BuddyPress site-wide activity stream. It has been forked, fixed and customized to suit the needs of MediaCore.<\/p>\n\n<p>You may find that you need to decrease your Simplepie cache time to make it work:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>add_filter( &#039;wp_feed_cache_transient_lifetime&#039;, create_function(&#039;$a&#039;, &#039;return 600;&#039;) );<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>reduces the RSS cache to ten minutes, for example. Put that in your bp-custom.php file if you are having problems with the plugin.<\/p>",
