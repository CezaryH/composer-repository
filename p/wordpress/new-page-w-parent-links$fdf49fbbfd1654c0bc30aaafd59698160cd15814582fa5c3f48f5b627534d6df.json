This allows you to create links in the front end of the website like \"Add a new page to this section\" or \"Create a new sub-page\". This is extremely useful when developing custom themes to add useful backend links on the front end of the site for users who have editing access. For using wordpress as a CMS, you really want to let the user avoid going through the clunky manage pages interface...<\/p>\n\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This should be a feature of wordpress<\/li>\n<li>I can't believe this isn't built into wordpress<\/li>\n<li>This has to rely on javascript because there's no suitable hook to do it another way<\/li>\n<li>Did I mention this should be built into wordpress?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h4>Feedback<\/h4>\n\n<p>Doubt you'll have any, but if you do, you can go to my website (<a href=\"http:\/\/theoephraim.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/theoephraim.com<\/a>)\nI wa",
