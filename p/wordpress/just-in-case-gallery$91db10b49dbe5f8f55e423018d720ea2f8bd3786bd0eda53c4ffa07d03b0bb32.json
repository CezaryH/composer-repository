                "description": "<p>The plugin creates a nicely animated gallery out of attachments to a post. A demo is available at just-in-case.tv. All pictures are shown on a kind of image wall. Once one clicks on one of them, it opens in a kind of lightbox (fullscreen). Using the arrows on the right and left side, it is possible to display the next or previous picture. Previews of next and previous picture are available.\nSince version 0.5, the plugin features individual facebook LIKE buttons for each picture in the gallery.<\/p>\n\n<p>Technically, it uses JQuery and needs Javascript to work.<\/p>\n\n<p>A demo installation is available at <a href=\"http:\/\/just-in-case.tv\" title=\"Embrace your grace ... and use the case! - Just in Case...\">just-in-case.tv<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>To use it, just install the plugin, attach some images to a post and insert [just_in_case_gallery] into the post. It works best with the theme Twenty Twelve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Have fun!<\/p>",
