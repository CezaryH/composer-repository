Adds a widget with additional options for easy installation on widgetized themes.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Big Update!<\/h4>\n\n<p>My Category Order has been out since WP 1.5 or 2.0 (2006) and it's been a struggle to keep it working smoothly. The taxonomy.php hack was hideous and a filter finally got added that let me avoid this. No more visiting the My Category Order page after every single Wordpress update!<\/p>\n\n<p>As of version 2.8.6 of the plugin I'm breaking backwards compatibility to add new features like a multiple widget instances. Keep using version <a href=\"http:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/my-category-order.2.8.3.zip\">2.8.3<\/a> if you are not on WP 2.8 yet.<\/p>",
