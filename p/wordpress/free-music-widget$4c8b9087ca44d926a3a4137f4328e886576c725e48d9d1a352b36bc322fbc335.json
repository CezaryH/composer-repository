The widget offers three feeds \n(Song Charts, Newest Songs, Editors Picks), and you can display 1-20 songs from \nany genre. The feed is cached locally for 1-hour. You may also display the songs \nfrom one specific band by inputting their band id from the unsigned band web. The \nwidget has been tested with wordpress 2.5 and WPMU 1.3 but should be compatible \nwith older versions.<\/p>",
