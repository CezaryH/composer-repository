                "description": "<p>About a year ago a friend of mine asked if I could make him an application for his disabled grandson. He has trouble connecting an image, let it be a picture or something he sees with his eyes, to words. He told me he started using the computer and Word to learn him to type. We&#8217;re talking about baby steps here: a single picture connecting to a single word. He asked me to basically make a system which allowed him input words and pictures, and his grandson to playfully learn to connect them.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not looking for a word-teaching system, then this is not the plugin for you. Don&#8217;t despair however! I&#8217;ve got another great plugin ready and I&#8217;ll definitely be making more in the future.<\/p>",
