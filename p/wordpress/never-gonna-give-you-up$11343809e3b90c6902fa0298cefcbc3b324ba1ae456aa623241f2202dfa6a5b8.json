When activated, it displays the lyrics to the Rick Astley song \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", which has become an internet phenomenon, in the top right corner of the admin panel. I'm not sure if this is technically classified as a rickroll, but I'm sure someone will get some enjoyment out of it.<\/p>",
