                "description": "<p>AWSOM Pixgallery is an Image Gallery\/Archive plugin designed to make it easier for Artists or Webcomic creators to set up a portfolio of their artwork. It features Automatic Watermarking, captioning using the Visual Editor or HTML, sorting, auto-thumbnailing, Comicpress theme support, per image\/gallery commenting and more. It is a Wordpress native Plugin and does not require any config or file changes or outside tool integration to work; just activate the plugin and add a line of text to any post or page and your Gallery of Images will appear. All options are handled through the regular Wordpress Admin interface. More features are in development now such as tagging, extensive theme control through Admin interface, and more.\nPart of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.AWSOM.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.AWSOM.org<\/a> series of Wordpress Plugins developed by Harknell, webmaster of the Webcomic at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.onezumi.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.onezumi.com<\/a><\/p>",
