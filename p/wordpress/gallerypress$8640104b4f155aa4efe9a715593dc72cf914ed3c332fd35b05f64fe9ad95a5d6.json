Galleries are constructed from any attachment type either by selecting and ordering attachments from the Media Library or by selecting a combination of Categories and Tags to display. When displayed, through Gallery Press, each attachment can also include custom metadata values.<\/p>\n\n<p>Using Gallery Press, you can upload new media files via a ZIP file. Each recognized file is added to the blog as a new attachment. If a tab delimited TXT file named metavalues.txt is included, it will populate each attachment's metadata values.<\/p>",
