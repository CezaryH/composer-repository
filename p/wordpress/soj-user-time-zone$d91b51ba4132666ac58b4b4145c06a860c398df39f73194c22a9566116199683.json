It just needs to take into account daylight savings time, but this is a little tricky because you need to keep a record somehow of past DST times for posts published in the past.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have a couple ideas for implementing this, but if anyone else has any brilliant ideas, please go for it. Another thing I intend to do is hook into <code>pre_option_gmt_offset<\/code> instead of the <code>get_the_time<\/code> filter, as it does now.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let me know of any problems: <a href=\"mailto:jj56@indiana.edu\">jj56@indiana.edu<\/a><\/p>",
