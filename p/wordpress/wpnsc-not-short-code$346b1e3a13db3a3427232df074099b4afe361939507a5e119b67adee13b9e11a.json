This is a common problem for plugin authors, and while a fix should be included by Wordpress 2.9 this plugin is so small and simple that it doesn't hurt to keep it included. Use a simple [wpNSC] [\/wpNSC] tag around your shortcodes to escape them. This plugin really couldn't be any simpler than that.<\/p>",
