But the similarities end there.<\/p>\n\n<p>QuickShare is quick because it doesn't run 3rd-party sharing JavaScript; in fact, there is <strong>no<\/strong> front-end JS. The sharing functions are built into links that take the user (in new tabs) to the native sharing interface on each social media site.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can choose which social media sites to include from: Facebook, Twitter, Pintrest, Linkedin, Google+, Tumblr, Reddit, and StumbleUpon. A basic email function is also available.<\/p>\n\n<p>The share bar appearance is highly customizable and share functions can be displayed as either icons, Genericons or text. Each display method features different customization options; customize through the settings page or with custom CSS.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a bonus, QuickShare includes several built-in CSS3 effects for hover state animations.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Please visit the plugin su",
