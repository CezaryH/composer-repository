This is done by simply connecting your kindle, then browsing it's documents folder that contains all the books on your Kindle, then selecting your favourite books.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once your books have been selected we then take the ISBN numbers from your selected books and send them to our central server, we then get the title, author and cover images for each of your books.<\/p>\n\n<p>This information is then displayed on the admin page and you can move the order of your books by dragging them, or remove them from the list by clicking the delete button.<\/p>\n\n<",
