However, the HTML is not always matching the design of the blog. This widget will allow people to paste MagCloud HTML code, write their own template, and with the help of some short codes they get the output that match their themes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please note that Magcloud gives us some HTML code that includes an image for the cover of the magazine that is hosted on their servers. This plugin will not copy it to our servers and will use the one Magcloud provides.<\/p>",
