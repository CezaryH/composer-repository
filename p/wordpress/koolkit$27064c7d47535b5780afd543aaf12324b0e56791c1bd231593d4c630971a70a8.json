                "description": "<p>Koolkit adds functions and short codes to let you enhance your theme, posts and pages. Currently there are two 'Kools' in the kit. The first is the post preview function which lets you show miniatureized snippets of your next set of posts in a pleasing format. The layout is fully CSS controllable and ready for jQuery. Just add  to your code.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second 'Kool' in this release is Kool Weather which provides weather for any location (assuming the data exists!) This one uses a short code ([KoolWeather location='your location']) so it can be easily added to posts and pages, widgets and so forth. Location can be a city,state combination or a city, country combination. Try Addis Abeba, Ethiopia or Caen, France. Right now it is just showing Farenheit but an additional code will be added in the next update to allow it to show celcius.<\/p>\n\n<p>3 more Kools are coming.
