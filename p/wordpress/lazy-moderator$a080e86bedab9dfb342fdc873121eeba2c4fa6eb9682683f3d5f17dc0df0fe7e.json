You input the username and that long long password, click \"Log Me In.\" There, you are welcomed with a silly \"Are you sure?\" confirmation message and two buttons: \"Yes I'm sooooo sure\" and \"No I'm not sure at all, my $200 mouse was just malfunctioning.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Ever felt that it's a little too much? Well, if you are that lazy (just like I am), then Lazy Moderator is just for you! Now the notification email will be appended with real \"one-click\" links to help you moderate the comment with just, well, one click. Yes, one click and it's done. No login. No confirmation. No hassles. No shit.<\/p>",
