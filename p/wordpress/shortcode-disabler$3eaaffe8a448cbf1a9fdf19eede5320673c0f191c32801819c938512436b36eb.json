Shortcode Disabler allows you to \"disable\" those old shortcodes by replacing them with nothing on the front end.<\/p>\n\n<p>Optionally, you can choose to display or hide the content of a shortcode.  In other words, this: <code>[some-shortcode]this is content[\/some-shortcode]<\/code> can become this: <code>this is content<\/code> on the frontend of your site.<\/p>",
