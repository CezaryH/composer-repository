                "description": "<p>SliceShow plugin for WordPress allows you to very quickly and easily create beautiful slide shows on your site. You can add titles and links that will overlay the images in your slideshow. You can create as many slideshows as you'd like and easily embed those into your posts and pages using the <code>[sliceshow id=\"1\"]<\/code> shortcode or directly in your templates using the php function <code>&#60;?php if( function_exists( 'sliceshow_slideshow' ) ) { sliceshow_slideshow( 1 ); } ?&#62;<\/code><\/p>\n\n<p>Slideshows are responsive as well, so they will scale from desktop to tablet to mobile sizes, automatically. Alternately you can define a custom size for your slideshow using \"fixed\" pizel sizes, which is great for those times when you need a slideshow to always be a specific size.<\/p>\n\n<p>Uploaded images are also automatically resized via php to optimize the loading times of your slideshow. No need to worry about your clients uploading 4000 pixel wide images and slowing down their site",
