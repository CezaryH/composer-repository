                "description": "<p>\"WooCommerce Email Validation\" is a small extension for WooCommerce that adds a 'confirm email address' field to the checkout page as a required field. This will ensure that your customers will enter a correct email address, making managing your orders far easier and more reliable. If a customer's email address does not match up then they will receive a standard validation error on the checkout page informing them that they need to make sure that their email addresses are the same.<\/p>\n\n<p>This extension is WooCommerce 2.x compatible and supports localisation using WPML.<\/p>",
