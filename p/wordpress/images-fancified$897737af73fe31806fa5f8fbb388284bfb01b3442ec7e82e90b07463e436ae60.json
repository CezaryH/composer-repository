Bigger versions of both individual images and gallery items are displayed using <a href=\"http:\/\/fancybox.net\/\">FancyBox<\/a> automatically.<\/li>\n<li>Attachment pages are disabled and entry points for linking to it are removed. Creating link to an attachment always creates a link to the file itself. Accessing an attachment page shows a 404.<\/li>\n<li>Gallery shortcode is also overridden to produce clearer syntax similar to the marvellous <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/cleaner-gallery\/\">Cleaner Gallery<\/a> plugin by Justin Tadlock.<\/li>\n<\/ul>",
