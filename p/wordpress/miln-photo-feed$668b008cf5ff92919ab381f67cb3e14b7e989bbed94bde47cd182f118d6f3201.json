                "description": "<p>Miln Photo Feed creates a photo feed using local photos attached to your posts. The feed contains one item per photo; each item includes the photo as both an inline src image and as a linked enclosure.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plug-in is ideal for sharing photos with family and friends who prefer to see images in iPhoto or through a RSS client, such as Google Reader.<\/p>\n\n<p>Photos attached but not visible within a post are included within the Miln Photo Feed. This lets you create a post highlighting a few photos, while also offering a photo feed containing many more photos.<\/p>",
