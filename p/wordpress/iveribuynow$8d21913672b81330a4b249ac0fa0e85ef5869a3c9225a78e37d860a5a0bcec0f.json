Using the shortcode system means you can insert as many Buy Now buttons you need into any post or page you desire.<\/p>\n\n<p>When a customer clicks on an inserted \"buy now button\" they're presented with an unobtrusive pop-up form to enter their contact and credit card details (all of which are forwarded to the iVeri Secure Payment Gateway for processing). On completion of the transaction, the customer is redirected back to your website with a customizable response message.<\/p>\n\n<p>Transactions are recorded for easy viewing in your Wordpress admin panel.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please note: Most compatible with PHP5<\/p>",
