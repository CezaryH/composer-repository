It also gives you the ability to add a (text) widget that allows you to add the feedburner tag as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin integrates with Worpdress' built-in scheduling system to cache the subscriber count. This allows it to be displayed quickly and efficiently.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/brandontreb.com\">http:\/\/brandontreb.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The URL below is demonstrating its use in the widget.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong> Sometimes the Feedburner API is unreliable and will return 0 results.  If it doesn't work the first time, just wait a while and try again.<\/p>",
