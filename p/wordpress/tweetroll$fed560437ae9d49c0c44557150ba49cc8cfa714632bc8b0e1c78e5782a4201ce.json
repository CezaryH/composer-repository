It shows your friends' avatars and invites your readers to come and follow you too.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin makes use of the TweetBurn server and doesn't reduce the number of API calls you can make without hitting Twitter's limit. It also automatically integrates with <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/6B8L7w\">Sponsored Tweets<\/a> and if you have an account on that service, it will automatically invite viewers to Sponsor one of your Tweets.<\/p>\n\n<p>Setting up the widget is simple, just install the plugin, activate, and specify your Twitter user name. Once the widget is installed, you can log into <a href=\"http:\/\/tweetburn.com\/\">Tweetburn<\/a> and change your colours, size and even captions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Are you listed in our <a href=\"http:\/\/tweetburn.com\/\">Tweetburn directory for Twitter users<\/a>?<\/p>",
