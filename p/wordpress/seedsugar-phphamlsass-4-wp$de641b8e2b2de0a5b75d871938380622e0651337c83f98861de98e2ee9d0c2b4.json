HAML replaces the tag soup of most HTML\/PHP templates with a cleaner, hierarchical markup language.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a simple plugin that only parses haml and sass\/scss with included php code to their respective php source and renders that.\nIt DOES NOT include any of rail's sophisticated templating tags, like link_to, image_tag etc..\nIf you want something like that you should take a look at the wordless plugin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any plain HTML\/PHP theme will work while PHAMLP for WordPress is enabled. But the individual templates that make up a WordPress theme, from index.php to author.php, can be replaced with a corresponding .php.haml file and PHAMLP for WordPress will process them.<\/p>\n\n<p>If enabled it will also check for sass\/scss stylesheet files, compile them and replace the links in the final output.\nJust link to them normally like you would to any other .css file.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin parses haml and sass files ",
