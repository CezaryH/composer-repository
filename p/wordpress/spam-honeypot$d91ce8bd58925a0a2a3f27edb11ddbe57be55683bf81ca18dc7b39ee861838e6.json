                "description": "<p>This plugin works by adding a textarea field to the comment form that's hidden\nusing a CSS style. Since bots don't generally detect CSS like this, they\nproceed to fill out the field like any other field. This implies that they\naren't a human (or they wouldn't even see the field with CSS hiding it) being\nusing a browser, in which case the plugin marks the comment as spam. This\nseems to catch the vast majority of spam with very few false results and\ndoesn't require contacting a third party service like most spam plugins.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you like this plugin, please consider making a small donation to support\nits development here: <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/K1jRVo\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/K1jRVo<\/a><\/p>",
