I installed Plogger, which seems to be a \ndecent bare-bones replacement.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, the one thing I missed about Flickr was the nice Wordpress \nwidget that showed my photos in the sidebar of my blog. So, I scratched \nmy own itch and wrote this widget. Presto - thumbnail images in the \nsidebar.<\/p>\n\n<p>You just assign it a Plogger feed URL and it does its thing. (The GPL \nPHP RSS library lastRSS is included - which makes this widget GPL too.)<\/p>\n\n<p>It is still very basic and needs some developer TLC to give it the \nfeatures that Plogger deserves.
