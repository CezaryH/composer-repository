However this means when someone enters one of your product pages using\na direct link, the breadcrumb will be empty. It will just show the link back to the main Shopp page. \nWith this plugin installed you can use breadcrumbs that show \"where you are\" in the hierarchical \nstructure of categories.<\/p>",
