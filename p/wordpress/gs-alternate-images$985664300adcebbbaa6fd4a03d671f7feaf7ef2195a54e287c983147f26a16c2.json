A programmer could use existing wp functions\nto extract the array from the postmeta and manipulate the images as they see fit, also using existing wp functionality.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition this plugin add shortcode support allowing non programmers to produce a gallery of images, or ustilize the images in\nsome other fashion.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example.<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>To get an array of alternate images attachment IDs\n\n$array_of_IDs = gs_get_alt_image_ids($post_ID); \/\/ post_ID = the page\/post ID that you want to retreive the images for.\n\n\nuse this method to get an array of objects of image",
