                "description": "<p>Social Kundi is the most powerful, simple and elegant wordpress social sharing solution. It adds Facebook Open Graph meta tags to your blog and allows you to call simple function from you template files, which places sharing functions on your blog (Facebook, Twitter and Google + 1).<\/p>\n\n<p>Unlike the other WordPress social-sharing plugins it requires minimal options to be set in order to work. It does not support social sites, which won&#8217;t have any effect on your site.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to have a long list of time-consuming, unnecessary set of options with loads of other features to be set, such as setting social sharing sites, icon sizes, colors, positions and so on, then this plugin is not suitable for you.\nSocial Kundi is intended for effective social sharing and it was carefully designed to be plain and simple.<\/p>",
