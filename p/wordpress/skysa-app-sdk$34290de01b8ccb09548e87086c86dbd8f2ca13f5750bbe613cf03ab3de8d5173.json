If you do not have your own Skysa App Bar integrated with your site, they will pull in a basic one for you so that the apps load correctly. If you do integrate your own Skysa App Bar with your site, your Skysa Bar apps will work with it instead, allowing you to configure all the features that the full Skysa App Bar service provides.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin includes the most recent version of the <code>skysa-required<\/code> directory which is required for the any Skysa Bar app plugins created with this SDK. Additionally, this plugin includes examples of working Skysa Bar apps which are fully documented to show exactly how to build a Skysa Bar app yourself.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h4><strong>Note<\/strong><\/h4>\n  \n  <p>This plugin is intended only for WordPress plugin developers to enable the creation of production WordPress plugins; it is not intended to be run in a production environment itself.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>",
