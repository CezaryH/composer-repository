                "description": "<p>Facetious lets you add a faceted - often called an 'advanced' - search form to your WordPress website. It comes with a ready-to-use sidebar widget, plus a number of implementation options for developers.<\/p>\n\n<p>A Facetious form can include dropdown lists of:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Taxonomy terms (tags, categories, and custom taxonomies)<\/li>\n<li>Months<\/li>\n<li>Plus a conventional search input box<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>You can also restrict searches by post type <em>(singular)<\/em>, if you so desire.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Facetious introduces an extra 'pretty permalink' structure around search queries, which may help your site performance if you're using a caching plugin like WP Super Cache. Also, they look a heck of a lot friendlier than <code>?s=polly&#38;post_type=pet&#38;category=bird<\/code>. (You don't even have to display a faceted search form on your site to benefit from these, by the way).<\/p>\n\n<p>Please note - Facetious isn't a replacement search engine; it helps you construct the search ",
