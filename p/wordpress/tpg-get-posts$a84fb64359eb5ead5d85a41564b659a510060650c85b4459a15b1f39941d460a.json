The posts can be selected by one or more tag values, suchs as tags, category or any other option supported by the WP get_posts function, to show only items relevant for the page.  It will also support displaying the post titles as a list.<\/p>\n\n<p>By default it will show the 5 most recent posts ordered in reverse date order,\nbut it will accept most of the options provided by the <a href=\"\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Template_Tags\/get_posts\">get_posts template tag<\/a>. If the value of the paramter is an array, it must be parsed by the plugin and not all parms have been implemented.<\/p>\n\n<p>To use it, just put the following into the HTML of any page or post, use as many times as you like on the same page:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>[tpg_get_posts]\n<",
