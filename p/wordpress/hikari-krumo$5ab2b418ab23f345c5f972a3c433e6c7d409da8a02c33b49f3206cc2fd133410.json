Original Krumo has a few bugs fixed and has its options available in an admin page instead of requiring krumo.ini file edited directly.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The simplicity of print_r() with the details of var_dump()<\/li>\n<li>Show any data, including its data type<\/li>\n<li>For arrays and objects, internal data are collapsed, so that it takes less space and you can expand to see only those values you really wanna see, spending much less space<\/li>\n<li>Works anywhere in Wordpress, backend and frontend<\/li>\n<li>Hide it from visitors and only those who really need to see dump be able to see it<",
