FlightLog will automatically figure out the latitude and longitude of the airport. If they are not fetched (seeing question marks instead of numbers), or if they are incorrect, click the name of the entry to edit them manually. Note: if you change the coordinates, FlighLog will automatically recalculate all flight distances and duration which use this airport.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>To edit an entry, click its name (hit the \"Update\" button when ready).
