For security purposes, only user accounts with subscriber role can be selected and any accounts selected will be prevented from accessing the wordpress backend. The custom login\/logout form is added to a template file using a PHP function 'pol_showform()'. Like with the standard login form, if you pass 'redirect_to' on the querystring, it will use this as the url to redirect to after the login\/logout.<\/p>",
