                "description": "<p>This plugins gives you a great framework to use for integrating with PayPal.\nIt stores both live and sandbox API credentials and allows you to switch back\nand forth easily.  All NVP API calls are passed through the framework and\ndefault values such as API version, API credentials, and even currency code are\nadded to the request based on settings from the admin panel.<\/p>\n\n<p>It also has a built in IPN listener that validates messages as coming from\nPayPal then throws WordPress actions based on messages received.  For example it\nthrows \"paypal-recurring_payment_profile_cancel\" when someone cancels a\nrecurring payment that they had set up with you.  It passes along all the info\nthat PayPal sent to the action, so it's simple to create other plugins that use\nthis one.<\/p>\n\n<p>Requires PHP5.<\/p>\n\n<p>You may also be interested in WordPress tips and tricks at <a href=\"http:\/\/wpinformer.com\">WordPress Informer<\/a> or gerneral <a href=\"http:\/\/webdevnews.net\">Web Developer News<\/a><\/p>",
