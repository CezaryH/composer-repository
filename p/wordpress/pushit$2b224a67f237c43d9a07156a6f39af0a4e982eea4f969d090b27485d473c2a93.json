Bye bye, spam comments and captcha plug-ins.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Pushit adds post recommendations via SMS, e-mail and social bookmarks like Facebook, Twitter and Bloggy. As a bonus, Pushit also gives you a neat print function and a nice set of related RSS links for a particular post.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The third major feature is the super compact mobile viewport for your web site!
