                "description": "<p>Note: Developer documentation, bug reporting information, and other miscellaneous notes are included under \"Other Notes\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently the search engine included in WordPress is very limited as to what types or categories of data it can locate and how a blog user can employ the system to locate them (search mode). For example, you cannot search blog posts with a simple strategy such as &#8220;find A string in category C&#8221;. You can&#8217;t perform a search such as &#8220;search all categories, but not category B&#8221;. It also doesn&#8217;t support advanced boolean search query formats (grouping, OR, NOT, AND).<\/p>\n\n<p>For these reasons, the WordPress search system needed an overhaul and enhancement. Members of a blog need to be able to find what they need quickly and efficiently. The search capabilities of WordPress should allow for a greater flexibility and power in search configuration and strategy so that blog users retrieve optimal relevant search results.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thi",
