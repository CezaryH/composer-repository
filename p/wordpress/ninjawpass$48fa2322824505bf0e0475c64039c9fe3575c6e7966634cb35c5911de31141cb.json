Whether your computer is infected by a keylogger or someone is\nspying over your shoulder, this protection will keep them away.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the plugin offers the possibility to receive an alert by\nemail whenever someone logs into your WordPress admin interface and to\nblock brute-force attacks.<\/p>",
