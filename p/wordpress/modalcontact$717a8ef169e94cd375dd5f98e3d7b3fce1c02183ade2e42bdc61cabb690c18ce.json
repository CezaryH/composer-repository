                "description": "<p>ModalContact is a database based contact form: it does use WP database for storage, instead of mailing form contents. The rationale is, sometimes, especially cheap hosting servers can be very restrictive. Most contact form plugins have issues with these servers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Besides this approach, as its name suggests, ModalContact has a modal form, so user does not have to leave the page. Contact Form pop ups on a overlay, just like the lightboxes.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is heavily based on work from Eric Martin, SimpleModal Contact Form.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Translations<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Since this plugin is heavily based on SMCF, you can easily translate it (if it has a SMCF translation in your language). .pot file is included.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you to all who have contributed these translations.<\/p>",
