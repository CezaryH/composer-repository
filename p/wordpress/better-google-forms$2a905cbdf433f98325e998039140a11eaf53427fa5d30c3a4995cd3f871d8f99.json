But wait (you're probably asking yourself) isn't this really easy thanks to that iFrame code that google gives us?<\/p>\n\n<p>Well sure, yes, you can do that. Except it looks really shitty! My plugin let's you style and fit the form to your theme, making it blend in seamlessly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Will auto-populate get variables into a form based off the label name (substituting \"_\" for spaces). So yourwebsite.com\/myform?First_Name=Bob&#38;Last_Name=Smith will fill in \"Bob\" and \"Smith\" for the inputs preceded by the labels \"First Name\" and \"Last Name\". Try THAT with your iFrame.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mojowen\/Better-Google-Forms\">Source code on GitHub<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mojowen\/Better-Google-Forms\/issues\">Report Issues to Github<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>",
