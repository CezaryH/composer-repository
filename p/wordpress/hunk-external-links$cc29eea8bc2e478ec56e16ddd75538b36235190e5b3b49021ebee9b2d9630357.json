You can use a class=\"noicon\" attribute on links to override this.<\/li>\n<li>Open outgoing links in new windows. Note that this can damage your visitor's trust towards your site in that they can think your site used a pop-under.<\/li>\n<li>Add rel=nofollow to the links. This is not very nice for those you're linking to, but useful to avoid PR leak.<\/li>\n<li>Open outgoing links in your own page, Then you can go back.<\/li>\n<\/ul>",
