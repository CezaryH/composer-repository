To prevent this you may want to make your auth cookies\nip-dependent so that they could be valid only for that ip which you used during login.<\/p>\n\n<p>Use this plugin only if you have a static IP or dynamic which doesn't change too often. Otherwise you'll\nhave to enter your login and password each time your IP changes.<\/p>",
