For optimal effectiveness, you should add multiple questions so that the spambots can't \"memorize\" the question and answer. The plugin will display questions at random to prevent the aformentioned memorization. Multiple answers can be added per question to account for variances in answers. (e.g. \"five\", \"Five\", \"5\")<\/p>\n\n<p>Plugin homepage: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.compdigitec.com\/apps\/wpnobot\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.compdigitec.com\/apps\/wpnobot<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Please drop a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.compdigitec.com\/labs\/2011\/10\/09\/wp-no-bot-question-plugin-for-wordpress\/\" title=\"WP No-bot Question plugin for WordPress\">comment<\/a> if it works for you, if you found any bugs or if you have suggestions\/ideas for this plugin - complaints welcome!<\/p>",
