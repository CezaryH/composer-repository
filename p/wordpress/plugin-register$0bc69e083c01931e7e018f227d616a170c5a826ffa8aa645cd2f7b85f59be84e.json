As part of that service the nice guys at Wordpress show you how many downloads of your plugin you get per day. Very useful, and if you're like me you check your downloads numbers too often.<\/p>\n\n<p>However what these stats don't show you is where your plugin is in use - which sites it is actually being activated on.
