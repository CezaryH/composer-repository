I have rewritten large segments of the code with validation and also load times in mind. Essentially it uses the APIs from 360Voice.com to display an assortment of data in a widget, or even in your template.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is nothing wrong with David&#8217;s plugin, it functions as required, even if it is rather messy and does not validate correctly. I am by no means trying to belittle his work, but offer an alternative.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Features<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<pre><code>* Display your badges\n* Display your blog entries\n* Display your favorites (most played)\n* Display your position in various 360V leaderboards\n* Display your 100% complete games\n* Widget enabled\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>All",
