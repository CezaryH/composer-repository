BBQ checks all incoming traffic and quietly blocks bad requests containing nasty stuff like eval(, base64_, and excessively long request-strings. This is a simple yet solid solution that works great for sites where .htaccess is not available. The BBQ script is available as a plugin for WordPress or standalone script for any PHP-powered website.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Features include<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Plug-n-play functionality<\/li>\n<li>No configuration required<\/li>\n<li>Born of simplicity, no frills<\/li>\n<li>Blocks a wide range of malicious requests<\/li>\n<li>Based on the <a href=\"http:\/\/perishablepress.com\/6g-beta\/\">5G\/6G Blacklist<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Scans all incoming traffic and blocks bad requests<\/li>\n<li>Works silently behind the scenes to protect your site<\/li>\n<\/ul>",
