Twitter News Feed allows you to import tweets tagged with certain hashtags from those users.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example you might want to import tweets from @johndoe and @janedoe containing the hashtag #news. Twitter News Feed can do this for you. There is no limit to the number of users or hashtags you can add. The main benefit being that you can power your news feed using Twitter as well as allowing the conversation to continue using Wordpress comments.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Automatically add Tweets as Posts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Twitter News Feed is designed to add the imported tweets as post",
