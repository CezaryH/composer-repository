Yes content theft and\nplagarism is a crime in some jurisdictions.<\/p>\n\n<p>You cannot rely on others or the authorities to continue to police the internet as they\ndo not have enough resources. You need to protect your content and deter this theft.<\/p>\n\n<p>The basic form of content theft is to copy and paste your content to another medium.<\/p>\n\n<p>Well Houdini, prevents this using a little known special algorithm that prevents copying by\nmaking the selected text that is targeted by the perps to be copied, to disappear! Yes disappear!!!\nThe only way to recover is to reload the page in the web browser. If they try again, the content\ndisappears again. As long as they keep trying to select and copy your content, the content will disappear\nbefore they can get a chance to execute the copy command!<\/p>\n\n<p>After",
