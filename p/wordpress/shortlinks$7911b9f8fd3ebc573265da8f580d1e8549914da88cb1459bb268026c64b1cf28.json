Having pretty urls is great, but also makes the website less flexible. For example, changing a posts published date will change the URL.<\/p>\n\n<p>While we can't control how other people will link to our site, we can control how we link to our internal sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>By default, with permalinks enabled, when visiting WordPress with a shortlink, WordPress will redirect you to the permalink URL.<\/p>",
