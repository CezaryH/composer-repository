Pressing the button conjures up a form that will let you fill out fields about the image, such as the name of the creator, and the URL of the license under which you are using the image.<\/p>\n\n<p>Press submit, and the plug-in will paste a nicely formatted string to the end of your editor.<\/p>\n\n<p>You could do this by hand of course, but I hope that this saves (a little) time, and that it will keep you from making typos.<\/p>\n\n<p>I am currently a happy user of my own plugin, and forsee no major changes in the future. Please let me know if there is any feature you could use.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Examples<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Photo<\/em> by John Smith.<\/li>\n<li><em>Photo of a fire truck<\/em> by John Smith, <em>some rights reserved<\/em>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>",
