                "description": "<p>SoloMail is a WordPress plugin designed to email an HTML-formatted copy of a single post to site subscribers or a mailing list. There are quite a few solutions out there designed to send batch digests of recent posts to subscribers on a scheduled basis. SoloMail solves a different problem - you may want to cherry pick just certain posts to go out via email, and you may want the ability to \"send now.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>The subscriber list can EITHER be the group of all registered users on a site OR a single address, such as a mailing list. Though you can use SoloMail either way, I recommend sending through a proper mailing list, which provides advantages such as handling and unsubscribing bounced\/dead addresses, and metered sending for large lists.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please send bug reports \/ requests via \n<a href=\"http:\/\/hosting.birdhouse.org\/contact\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/hosting.birdhouse.org\/contact\/<\/a><\/p>",
