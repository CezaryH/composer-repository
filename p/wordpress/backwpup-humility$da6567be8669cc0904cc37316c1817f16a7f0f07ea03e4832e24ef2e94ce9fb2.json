It also removes the additional step of viewing, scrolling and saving the long \"About\" page of that plugin every time you did an update. As a result you can access the settings and admin pages of that plugin every time you want and will be no longer interrupted\/ blocked at that.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>However, \"BackWPup\" itself is a really useful plugin and it is highly recommended that you should make backups regularly. Period. The \"BackWPup\" plugin helps you with that and is a great alternative. You should support its developers and donate or buy the pro version.<\/p>\n\n<p>My plugin was simply made to save the hassles of updating several dozen WordPress installs and everytime doing the same stupid clicks that have no sense, only to finally access the settings\/ admin pages of a plugin again.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/g",
