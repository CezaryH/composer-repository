This plugin is no different.<\/p>\n\n<p>Well, it is different in that it provides one new way to display the tags: cloudily.<\/p>\n\n<p>The usual format is for tags with a smaller post count to have a smaller font size and larger counts a larger font size.  Cloudy Tags still allows that, but it adds the property of cloudiness.  So tags with smaller post counts are cloudier and larger counts are clearer or sharper.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin page is at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.someblogsite.com\/web-stuff\/cloudy-tags\/\">Some Blog Site<\/a>.<\/p>",
