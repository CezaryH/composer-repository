Clicking a thumbnail displays it as the main image.\nThis gallery doesn't use Lighbox, but it can be added easily by adding a link and a  'lightbox' class to the main image (Providing off-course having downloaded and activated the 'lightbox' plugin). \n<em>Important Notice:<\/em>\nThe name of the plugin directory was changed from yasg to yet-another-simple-gallery when it was created in the plugin's repository. That made all paths to scripts, css and images to break. :-(. If the plugin doesn't work for you, please remove it and download it again. This should fix the problem. I am terribly sorry for this mishap.<\/p>\n\n<p>Major new features in YASG 1.1 include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Adding captions to main image: the image caption is displayed under the main image, and the image description is set as the alternative text and title - pops up on mouse over.<\/li>\n<li>Im",
