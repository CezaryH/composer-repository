The plugin works with all the WooCommerce product types - simple and external products will display a badge that says 'Save $X!', while variable and grouped products will display 'Save up to $X!'.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is WooCommerce 2.x and WPML compatible.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you would like a more fully featured sale badge enhancement extension then be sure to check out Sale Flash Pro available for purchase from the WooThemes website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.woothemes.com\/products\/sale-flash-pro\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.woothemes.com\/products\/sale-flash-pro\/<\/a> (Sale Flash Pro was not written by me, but because WooCommerce Smart Sale Badge contains a limited feature set of Sale Flash Pro I will not be adding further features to this plugin).<\/p>",
