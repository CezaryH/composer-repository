                "description": "<p>This is a very simple plugin that i created for one of my projects. However, i believe that others will find it useful and so i decided to upload it to wordpress.org. \nthere are no settings or many feature. The plugin simply adds a button \"post update\" to the toolbar. Once a user (logged in) clicks on the button a form will pop up. The form will have a text area for the user to enter any update\nand another input to enter a link to a video. When the user submit the form the plugin will post the info to his activity stream.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have not planned on this plugin or have any plans for it for the future. However, you are more than welcome to send suggestion to <a href=\"mailto:info@geomywp.com\">info@geomywp.com<\/a>. If the plugin will get attention and requestes i will be more than happy to extend it and its features.<\/p>",
