One of the biggest draws is the popular music game 'RockBand', and I have ~1,200 songs for folks to choose from. I have a spreadsheet with all of my songs sorted by artist, but people have been asking me to put it online so they can request new songs from home. The solution was this plugin!<\/p>\n\n<p>CSV to SortTable is great for anyone who keeps track of important information using a spreadsheet. It could be used for product catalogs, inventory lists, or even leaderboards in a competition.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Use<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Add the contents of a .csv file by placing this shortcode into your post or page.<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>[csv2table source=&#34;http:\/\/mydomain.com\/mydatafile.csv&#34;]<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Shortcode Parameters<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Use a comma-separated list of column numbers to indicate which columns should be treated as unsor",
