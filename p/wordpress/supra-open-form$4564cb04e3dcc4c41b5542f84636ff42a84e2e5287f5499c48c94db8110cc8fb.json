Shortcode can be provided in whatever page one wishes to display the form. The shortcodes are provded in the Form Info tab. When creating the form you have the option to provide the landing page or a success message instead. If the landing page is left blank the form will display a success message up submission. You can create the following inputs: select, hidden, checkboxes, radios, textareas and submit buttons. You can provide arbitrary attributes for each input as needed. You can also specify a notifcation email for the submission to be sent to. The code is clean, decoupled and modifiable and the interface is jQuery interactive. The form builder requires simple html knowledge such as what should go in in label, name and value attributes.<\/p>\n\n<p><\/p>",
