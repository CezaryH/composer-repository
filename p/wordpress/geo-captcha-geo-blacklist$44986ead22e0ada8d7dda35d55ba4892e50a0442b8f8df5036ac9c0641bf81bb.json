IMPORTANT !!!\nIf you have used the old Geo-Captcha plugin please completly uninstall it (the form is on the main page of the plugin) \nand remove the plugins files. Geo-Captcha &#38; Geo-Blacklist ist fully based on the old Geo-Captcha plugin but is not \ncompatible with it and uses new names for options and databases!\n!!! IMPORTANT !!!<\/p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of ways to prevent spam. One that is still pretty often used is to let your readers type a code from a\ncaptcha image to a textbox. Geo-Captcha uses the same technic but you can define a whitelist with countries. People from\nthis countries will not be forced to enter the captcha code. You can also define a blacklist which prevents people from\nsome countries from posting any comments.<\/p>\n\n<p>The location of the visitors is checked using the GeoLite Country-Library from MaxMind (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxmind.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.maxmind.com<\/a>).\nThe captcha image is generated using SecurImage from drew010 (<a href=\"ht",
