Here we present InterLinking - a simple tool that helps you to link a specific keyword with respective URL throughout the blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>This will help when you want to emphasise on a few specific pages for specific terms. A simple example: set the keyword to 'Contact Us Now' and use the URL: yourdomain.com\/contact-us\/. Now every time you use the phrase 'Contact Us Now' - it will get linked to your contact page.<\/p>\n\n<p>More importantly, this plugin works well to link to external websites.<\/p>",
