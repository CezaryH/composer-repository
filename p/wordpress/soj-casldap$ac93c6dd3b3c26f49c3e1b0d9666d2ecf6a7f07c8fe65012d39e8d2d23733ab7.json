Default user roles can be assigned based on LDAP group membership, and accounts can be auto-created for users that exist in LDAP, but not yet in WordPress.<\/p>\n\n<p>It assumes that, for CAS authentication, the user is redirected to an outside address, then back to the referring address; that's how it works where I'm at :-). You can also specify a group in LDAP that will always have admin privileges; useful for tech staff.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before the plugin is used, the constants in <code>soj-ldap_constants.inc.php<\/code> must be filled out. The CAS default password is the one the user is registered with in WordPress; so all WP users will have this password. Be ",
