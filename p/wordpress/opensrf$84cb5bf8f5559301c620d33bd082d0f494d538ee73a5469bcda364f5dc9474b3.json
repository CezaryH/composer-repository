You can use OpenSRF to build loosely-coupled applications that can be deployed on a single server or on clusters of geographically distributed servers using the same code and minimal configuration changes. Although copyright statements on some of the OpenSRF code date back to Mike Rylander\u0092s original explorations in 2000, Evergreen was the first major application to be developed with, and to take full advantage of, the OpenSRF architecture starting in 2004. The first official release of OpenSRF was 0.1 in February 2005 (<a href=\"http:\/\/evergreen-ils.org\/blog\/?p=21\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/evergreen-ils.org\/blog\/?p=21<\/a>), but OpenSRF\u0092s development continues a steady pace of enhancement and refinement, with the release of 1.0.0 in Oct",
