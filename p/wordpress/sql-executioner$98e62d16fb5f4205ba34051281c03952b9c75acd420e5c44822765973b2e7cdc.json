In many cases this allows you to bypass\nthe inherent limitations of the WordPress Admin interface, and use the full expressive\npower of SQL to analyze and update your blog's database.<\/p>\n\n<p>To use simply install and visit the Tools &#62; SQL Executioner page.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you're interested in contributing to the code behind this plugin, it's also hosted on GitHub:\n<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/justincwatt\/wp-sql-executioner\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/github.com\/justincwatt\/wp-sql-executioner<\/a><\/p>",
