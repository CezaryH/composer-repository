But it also does a whole lot more. You can track multiple Twitter accounts and store all of the tweets on your blog indefinitely (currently Twitter only keep your 3,200 most recent tweets) as well as pulling in any tweets that you reply to for future reference. You can then tweet from your Dashboard or have HL Twitter automatically tweet your new posts with a customisable message.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Twitter 1.1 Compatible<\/strong><\/p>",
