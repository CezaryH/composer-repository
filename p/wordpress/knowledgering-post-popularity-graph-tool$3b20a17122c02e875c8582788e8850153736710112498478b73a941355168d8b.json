Ratings are measured only if GD Star Rating plugin is installed and active. Views look for a \"views\" custom field and assumes it is tracking the views of the page so any plugin that stores view count using \"views\" as the post meta will work ( future update will allow you to specify the custom field to use). Facebook likes and retweets require you to setup an hourly cronjob to fetch likes and retweet values for your posts from facebook and twitter. Post popularity is shown with a horizontal bar graph below the post if you check \"Use content filtering to append popularity graph\". Otherwise you can manually insert the function code where you prefer within your post template page. You can also show a list under the main post popularity graph which displays a graph for the individual item percentages (ie views, ratings, comments, retweets, ",
