You won&#8217;t need SSL certificates, shopping carts, or piles of books in your basement. All you&#8217;ll need is an affiliate account and a website. Oh, and a book.<\/p>\n\nBenefit #1 - Easy to Use\n\n<p>We&#8217;re building MyBookTable from the ground up to be easy to use, even for technophobes. We will also build in tutorial videos to walk you through every step. The PRO &#38; DEVELOPER levels also come with support just in case you get stuck. We will be continually improving and refining the plugin throughout the year.<\/p>\n\nBenefit #2 Search Optimized\n\n<p>Most authors don&#8217;t rank for their own book titles on Google. Scary, right? That means someone else (coughAmazoncough) is cashing in on your hard work. MyBookTable will help you retake control. Ranking #1 on search engines for your book title is extra valuable when you have affiliate accounts set up (see benefit #3).<\/p>\n\nBenefit #3 ",
