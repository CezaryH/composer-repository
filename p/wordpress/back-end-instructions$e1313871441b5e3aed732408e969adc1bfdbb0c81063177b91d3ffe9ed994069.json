Then you provide said client with instructions - either via printed manual, video tutorials, or even emails - but no matter how many ways you tell them how to use the site you just made for them, they keep asking you for instructions?<\/p>\n\n<p>I've found this is typically because most clients want instructions that appear \"in your face\".
