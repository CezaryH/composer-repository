Make your editing experience as simple and good as possible:<\/p>\n\n<p>Customize TinyMCE \/ TinyMCE Advanced (or other TinyMCE variants) to fit your needs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically, this Plugin does two things for you:<\/p>\n\n<p>A. This Plugin installs two files editor-style.css and editor-style-shared.css into your Theme folder (so you can still do updates of the Plugin), which can be edited in the backend of your site<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>editor-style.css is used for styling your TinyMCE Editor<\/li>\n<li>editor-style-shared.css is used for styles to be used in your theme AND in your TinyMCE editor (so you do not have to copy)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Note: To use this feature, you have to write your own CSS code into this files, which is the only professional way to do it.<\/p>\n\n<p>B. The main feature of this Plugin is to offer a GUI to create custom style formats for TinyMCE dynamically<\/p>\n\n<",
