                "description": "<p>While working on a custom WordPress theme we needed the ability to feature users \/ authors. So we created this plugin which allows the administrator to easily star (featured) users. Then using a custom query in the theme we where able to get only the featured users by only retrieving users with the custom user meta &#34;jsfeatured_user&#34;. The plugin dosent make any chanages to your current theme it only does the following:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Adds a featured column in the Users panel of the WordPress Admin<\/li>\n<li>When a user is featured the plugin adds or updates the custom filed &#34;jsfeatured_user&#34; and sets the value to yes.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Feel free to use and include in your WordPress Installs, please think of us if you need a custom theme or plugin developed!!<\/p>\n\n<p>For Plugin and Theme development requets email us at <a href=\"mailto:info@reactivedevelopment.net\">info@reactivedevelopment.net<\/a> or go here <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reactivedevelopment.net\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/",
