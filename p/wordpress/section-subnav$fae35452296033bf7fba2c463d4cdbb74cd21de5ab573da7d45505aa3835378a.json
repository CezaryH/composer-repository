For example, consider the following common navigation tree structure:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Home<\/li>\n<li>Item<\/li>\n<li>About Us\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sub-item #1<\/li>\n<li>Sub-item #2<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Item<\/li>\n<li>Item<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Then, whenever on the \"About Us\" page or any of its sub-items, it would output that peice of the navigation:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>About Us\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sub-item #1<\/li>\n<li>Sub-item #2<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This is particularly useful for websites that have a top horizontal navigation which shows top-level items and want to show a vertical subnavigation in the sidebar.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin works by parsing the output of the <code>wp_nav_menu<\/code> function as XML and analyzing the CSS class hooks (current-menu-ancestor, current-menu-item, and current-menu-parent).  Because it uses PHP's SimpleXML library it therefore requires PHP 5+.  It uses the theme's registered menu loca",
