When it comes to giving your client a high level picture of progress most systems are overkill.<\/p>\n\n<p>Clients don't want to be bogged down by to-do lists, milestones and calendars. They want to know how far a project is from completion and what they are responsible for.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is a simply way to give clients that information while providing you with a high level overview of open projects and their standpoint. The plugin gives you the ability to:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create and manage unlimited projects<\/li>\n<li>Track levels of completion<\/li>\n<li>Track current tasks<\/li>\n<li>Identify client responsibilities and project holds<\/li>\n<li>Identify four major milestones (20%\/40%\/60%\/80%)<\/li>\n<li>Send clients to a page containing the above information<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Projects are displayed in a responsive template so clients can access and monitor",
