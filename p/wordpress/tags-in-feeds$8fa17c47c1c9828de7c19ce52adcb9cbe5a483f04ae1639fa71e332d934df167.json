I take care choosing the tags on my\nposts; I want them to show up in the feeds.<\/p>\n\n<p>A more thorough plugin would allow you to customize which things\nshowed up in your feeds -- possibly categories, possibly tags, who\nknows what else?<\/p>\n\n<p>N.B. this is a total hack that takes advantage of how RSS\/Atom is\nimplemented in WP 2.8.4 or whatever I'm running. Basically, intercept\nthe calls that indicate what kind of feed it is, and then filter the\ncontent to look like it has a \"Filed under\" block at the top. I expect\nthis plugin to stop working arbitrarily soon, at which point your\nWordpress install will probably start behaving extremely badly.<\/p>\n\n<p>N.B. I couldn't find anything to intercept that would tell me if it\nwas \"just\" RSS (RSS 0.9), so this functionality probably won't work on\nthose feeds.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you haven't yet gotten the idea that this is extremely sloppy work,\nREAD AGAIN",
