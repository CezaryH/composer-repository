Mingle Forum has been modified to be lightweight, solid, secure, quick to setup, easy to use, and best of all it now integrates seamlessly with or without the Mingle social networking plugin (by Blair Williams). The mission of Mingle Forum is, to <strong>KEEP IT SIMPLE<\/strong> There are a handful of Forum Plugins for WordPress available but they are either super buggy, difficult to install, or so bloated with features and settings that its a nightmare setting them up. Dont do that to yourself!!! You can be up and running with Mingle Forum fully installed and configured in as little as 5 minutes -- pretty cool eh?<\/p>\n\n<h4>Donate<\/h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/cartpauj.com\/projects\/cartpauj-post-hits-plugin\/\">GET A FREE PLUGIN WHEN DONATING<\/a><\/p>\n\n<h4>See Mingle Forum In Action<\/h4>\n\n<p>You can try Mingle Forum out on my site:\n<a href=\"http:\/\/cartpauj.com\" title=\"cartpauj.com Wordpress",
