I hate when I can't navigate a blogs posts directly from one to the \nnext so\nI decided to create this plugin.  If the owner of the blog chooses to include \nthese\nlinks, now they can and not have to know how to code them in.  I know a lot\n of bloggers\nare not necessarily php coders, so I figured I would create this plugin \nto make it as\neasy as possible for them to add this functionality.<\/p>",
