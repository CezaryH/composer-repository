Once installed, go to Settings-&#62;WP Logger and enable logging. If you have a number of supported plugins enable the one you are interested in.<\/p>\n\n<p>Developers who want to use this plugin to add logging to their own plugin should see the Developers section of this documentation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mark Jaquith's <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/monitor-pages\/\">Monitor Pages<\/a> plugin was used as a template for this plugin. Thanks Mark!<\/p>\n\n<h4>Developers<\/h4>\n\n<p>Other plugins can use this plugin to record important events which are then dumped to a log file. Plugins must add the event to a global array in the following way:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>$GLOBALS[ &#039;wp_log&#039; ][ &#039;name_of_plugin&#039; ][] = &#039;So",
