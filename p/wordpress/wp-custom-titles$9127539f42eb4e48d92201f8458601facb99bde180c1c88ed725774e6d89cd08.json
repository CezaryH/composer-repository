For example, you have a page called FAQ which will appear in the nav menu as FAQ and you add a custom field custom_title with \"Frequently Asked Questions\" then the page title will appear as \"Frequently Asked Questions\" on the \/faq\/ page, but in the menu it's still FAQ.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin was inspired by the <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/wp-title-2\/\" title=\"The WP Title 2 plugin\">WP Title-2<\/a> plugin but uses a <strong>much<\/strong> simpler approach. There is no menu or interface of any kind. You simply add a custom field to the posts you want to modify.<\/p>",
