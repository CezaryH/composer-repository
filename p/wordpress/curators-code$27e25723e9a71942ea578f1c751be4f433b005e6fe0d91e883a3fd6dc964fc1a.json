While you may still choose to use \"via\" and \"HT\" the old-fashioned way &#8211; the goal here is to attribute ethically, regardless of how you do it &#8211; there are two reasons we are proposing the unicode characters: One, they are a cleaner, more standardized way to attribute. Two, since the characters are wrapped in a hotlink to the Curator's Code site, they serve as messengers for the ethos of the code itself, as people encounter them",
