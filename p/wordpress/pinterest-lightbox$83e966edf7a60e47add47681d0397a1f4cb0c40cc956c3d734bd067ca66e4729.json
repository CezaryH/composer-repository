                "description": "<p>With over 5 million downloads the NextGEN Gallery plugin is obviously widely used. The Pinterest Lightbox plugin enables a PinIt Button on each image automatically through your NextGEN Gallery.  It automatically uses the caption, image URL, and page URL from NextGEN to sync with the Pinterest API.  This plugin is very useful for photo-intensive websites.<\/p>\n\n<p>To use it, simply download, and activate.  To prevent confliction with the default Lightbox included in NextGEN navigate to Gallery -&#62; Options -&#62; Effects Tab, and from the dropdown \"JavaScript Thumbnail effect\" select None.  Everything should be working great!  Check the screenshots for any confusion.<\/p>",
