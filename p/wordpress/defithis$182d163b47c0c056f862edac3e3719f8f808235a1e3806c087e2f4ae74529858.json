If you read the online version of NYTimes, you know what are we talking about.\nNote that even though this plugin is similar to the NYTimes gadget, it's not the same. The plugin is way smaller in size and does not rely on any Javascript framework. The plugin adds its admin the ability to choose between services which provides the definitions, in the first release we put 3 services: Google (recommended), Dictionary.com and Answers.com.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you'd like to learn more about DefiThis, visit us at the <a href=\"http:\/\/devoracles.com\/wp-plug-defithis\/785\">plugin's homepage<\/a>. It would be also cool if you'd drop a comment and share your thoughts with us.<\/p>",
