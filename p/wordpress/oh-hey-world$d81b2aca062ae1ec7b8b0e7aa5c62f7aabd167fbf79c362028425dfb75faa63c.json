You MUST have a Oh Hey World account to use this plugin.<\/p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Oh Hey World is currently in BETA. You can sign up using this link for a limited time <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ohheyworld.com\/?registration_code=330cc74a-31e3-4351-8573-e04164c6b59b\">using THIS LINK<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>With the Oh Hey World plugin, travel bloggers can quickly and easily keep their current location up to date using what WordPress calls \"shortcodes\" and into their sidebars using the included widget. Rather than manually changing text within the theme to update your location, you can check-in when you arrive at a new location with one click and that will automatically update the location listed on your travel blog, share your location on Twitter and Facebook, and email or text your parents, significant other, and\/or close friends.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to the sidebar widget, there are two shortcodes:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>[curren",
