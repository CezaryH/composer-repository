It contains a real-time AJAX calculation option, which degrades gracefully on older browsers and uses a button to calculate repayments.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin also contains an application form which sends a message to a specified email address.<\/p>\n\n<p>The calculator features payment protection, and 12 to 60 months calculation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin can be used for car purchases or payments, real estate and big loans calculations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"http:\/\/getbutterfly.com\/wordpress-plugins\/finance-calculator-with-application-form\/\" title=\"getButterfly\">official homepage<\/a> for feedback and support.<\/p>",
