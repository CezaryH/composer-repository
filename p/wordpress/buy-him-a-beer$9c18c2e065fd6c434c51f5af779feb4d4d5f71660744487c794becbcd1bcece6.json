What if you could buy them your favorite beer? This plugin allows you to put a custom \"Buy Me a Beer\" button on your blog. When a visitor clicks on the button, they will be taken to buyhimabeer.com to choose a beer for you. Once they have chosen a beer, the visitor will click on a buy button which directs them to Paypal to pay you for the beer. Using the buyhimabeer service is completely free and doesn't require any type of account. Buyhimabeer.com doesn't collect any information about its users.<\/p>",
