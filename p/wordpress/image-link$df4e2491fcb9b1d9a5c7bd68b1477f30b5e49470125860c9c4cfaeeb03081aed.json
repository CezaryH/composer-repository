There isn't any rocket science here - it's simply up to the post author to provide the image (and text) in the optional excerpt in WordPress' write a post form. However, the \"trick\" bit is to make that thumbnail image a hyper-link to the post. I've done this with this simple WordPress plug-in.<\/p>",
