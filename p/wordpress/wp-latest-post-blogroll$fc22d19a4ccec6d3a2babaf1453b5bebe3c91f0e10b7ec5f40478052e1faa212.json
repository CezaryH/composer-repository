It fetches the most recent post title for each blog listed in the blogroll. The blogroll is then presented as a list of links to these latest blog posts. Instead of a static list of links to the blogroll sites, the links list appears differently with every blog post published.<\/p>\n\n<p>WP Latest Post Blogroll updates your links list with the last post title for each link. With a dynamic blogroll your site will always be current with no more effort from you. All you have to do is install and activate the plugin. There are no options to fiddle with!<\/p>",
