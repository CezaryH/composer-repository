This has to be done with every translated menu where you want the flags to appear. So, if you just have translated a \nmenu. Go back to the options of the widget and you will see that this translated menu is added to the list. Select this menu too and\nsave the options.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can also add an additional class for the IMG and LI tag. On the LI tag is automatically added the class \"not-last\" for all\nflag items but the last one, and \"last\" for the last flag.<\/p>\n\n<",
