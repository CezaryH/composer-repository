What it does is add in social media links to your Contact Info section in your user profile for popular social media sites such as Google Plus, Twitter and Facebook.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you fill in one or more of those fields, 16 x16 icons will appear next to your name when your name appears as the author of a blog post. This lets readers easily find your social media information as they read and is completely unique to each author.<\/p>",
