If your client calls saying her ancient phone won't call a number on his site when she clicks on it this is the plugin for you.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Telephone Number Linker Features<\/h4>\n\n<p>Uses up-to-date list of browsers to detect that the visitor is using a mobile device.\nIn that case loads a jQuery script to enclose the telephone number in a link.<\/p>\n\n<h4>About the Author<\/h4>\n\n<p>Stoatoffear is a web and graphic designer and fine artist.\nPlease visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gravitydesign.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.gravitydesign.co.uk<\/a> for your web and graphic design needs.\nVisit ",
