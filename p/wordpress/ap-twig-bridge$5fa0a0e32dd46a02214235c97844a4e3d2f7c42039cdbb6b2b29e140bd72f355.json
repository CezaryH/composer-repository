                "description": "<p>AP Twig Bridge is a bridge between Wordpress and Twig. Wordpress is a great system mainly because of its simplicity,\nbut it is a headache to create templates for it. PHP-mess is not good for creating templates, that's why\nthere are different template engines. Twig is a new powerful template engine developed by <a href=\"http:\/\/fabien.potencier.org\/\">Fabien Potencier<\/a>. \nIt has very clear and simple syntax, inspired by Django and Jinja. So, if you ever thought of using some templating engine in Wordpress, try this plugin.\nFor now this plugin has a limited support for Wordpress API, but I'm going to develop it further.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Your Feedback Matters<\/h4>\n\n<p>Bugs to report?
