Unfortunately, most of them are annoying. Either they have poor documentation, or they require you to insert funny things into your posts, or they are slow, or whatever.<\/p>\n\n<p>KB Easy PicasaWeb is the easiest, fastest, most visitor-friendly Picasa plugin for WordPress.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easiest<\/strong>: This plugin does not require you to insert funny markup into your posts--all you need is a link to a Picasa album, and the plugin does the rest.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fastest<\/strong>: The plugin uses efficient caching to keep your blog's pageloads quick.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Most visitor friendly<\/strong>: The plugin uses PHP, not JavaScript, so it won't cause errors or annoying movement when loading. (If you've used JS-based Picasa plugins, you'll know what I mean.) Even your grandmother can view your photos if you use this plugin.<\/li>\n<\/u",
