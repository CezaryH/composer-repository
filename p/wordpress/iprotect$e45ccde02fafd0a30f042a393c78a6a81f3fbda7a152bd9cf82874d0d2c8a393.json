Personally, I view the web with a very CC-BY-SA attitude, but if you are an artist, graphic designer, photographer or similar then I can appreciate this makes your life a little difficult.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have put this plug-in together to help discourage those people who refuse to play nice.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>This is not a fool-proof method - nothing is!<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>It doesn't matter what you do - if you put something on the web then someone else will be able to take it. You can't stop it. If you don't like that, don't put it on the web.<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway... this plug-in attempts to confuse the would-be-pilferers by overlaying a transparent gif over any images you embed in your main blog content. Simple enough.<\/p>",
