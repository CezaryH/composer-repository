It works because your visitors must use obfuscated javascript to submit a proof-of-work that indicates they opened your website in a web browser, not a robot. If the javascript check fails, WP Hashcash now gives you three options; it can either put the comment into moderation (default), put the comment in the akismet queue, or delete it.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can read more at the <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress-plugins.feifei.us\/hashcash\/\">WP Hashcash plugin<\/a> page.
