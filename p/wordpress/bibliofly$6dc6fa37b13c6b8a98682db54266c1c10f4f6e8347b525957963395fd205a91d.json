Originally created to manage an author's list of titles, it has also been put to use storing reviewing information. Biblio entries can be marked as published or unpublished, or marked as not visible so they won't display prematurely. There are functions to embed a list of recent publications in a sidebar, and to print out a full bibliography page, sorted by type (novel, short story, etc). Embed a bibliography entry in a post or page. There's also a notes field (for review highlights, links elsewhere etc).<\/p>",
