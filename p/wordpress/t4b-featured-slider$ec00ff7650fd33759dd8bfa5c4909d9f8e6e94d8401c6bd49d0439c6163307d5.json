                "description": "<p>\"T4B Featured Slider\" is a simple and easy WordPress plugin. You can use this plugin as an alternate of WordPress sticky posts. First, you have to add the ID of featured posts. To get the ID of a post simply enter the URL of the post in the given text field and then click on Get ID button. Copy the ID and paste into the second text field where the Add ID button exists. After that, click on Add ID button. If nothing goes wrong you will get a confirmation message that you have successfully inserted the post-ID. You can also remove a featured post by entering the ID of a post in the third text field. After entering the ID, click on the Delete ID button. At the end, you will be shown all the featured posts list that you have added. Now, if you want to show the featured slider, then enable the featured slider, which is located at the top of settings page. Finally, copy the code (to get the code see FAQ) and paste where you want to show featured slider.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Usage<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Insta",
