                "description": "<p>FeedBack is a standard inspired by PingBack, and designed to establish relatively secure push \nmechanisms for feed sharing and management. Feedback is standard developed in the frame of \niCamp project (See <a href=\"http:\/\/www.icamp.eu)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.icamp.eu)<\/a>. To be able to understand the point, just imagine you are subscribed to different newspapers,\nand each newspaper sends an e-mail to you whenever something new happens, and whenever you open your\ninbox you see some mails coming from different newspapers, which means in your inbox you hold an aggregated\ncontent of different newspapers. So, feedback plug-in for Wordpress enables you to use such mechanism for blogs, in our\nexample the subscription was one way, but in feedback case each blog owner can subscribe and can be\nsubscribed by others. If you subscribe other people's blogs, whenever a user posts something, your\nblog is \"notified\" and you get the updated content, which enables you to reach an aggregated conte",
