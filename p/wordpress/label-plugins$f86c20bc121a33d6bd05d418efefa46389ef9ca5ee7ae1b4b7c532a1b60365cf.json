As developer I need sometimes a ranking for plugins. So I decided,  there have to be a way to label plugins or assign a category to them. On Macintosh computers you had this option for files since ages.<\/p>\n\n<p>That is why I was writing a code to label WordPress plugins. The labels in the moment are neutral(initial), bad, average, good but also can think of labels like paid, modified, free or something else in the next version.<\/p>\n\n<p>Labeling WordPress plugins has never been so easy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Then you can show plugins from certain categories or for example deactivate all bad plugins at once.<\/p>",
