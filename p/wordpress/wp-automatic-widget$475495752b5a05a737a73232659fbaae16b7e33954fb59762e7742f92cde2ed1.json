By this plugin you can add and remove your widgets automatically. You set your Start Date and End Date in the plugin and everything will be done for you!\nFor instance you want to insert a banner or advertisement for the coming new year but you can not do it just at the exact coming new year time! So whenever you have time you can set a future Start Date and an End Date in this plugin and everything is just done with that! The plugin itself inserts your banner at the given Start Date and End Date.\nFor another example you can make a deadline for your banner by just giving an End Date in the plugin and the banner starts but will be removed on the End Date automatically.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are three different ways:<\/p>\n\n<p>1) Manually<\/p>\n\n<p>It is just like HTML Text Widget but you can use Twitter Bootstrap Classes, access to Media Library and insert links and images easily and qui",
