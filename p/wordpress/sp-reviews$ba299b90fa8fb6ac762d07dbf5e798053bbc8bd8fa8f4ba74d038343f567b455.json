You can show your rating average by using a widget, or display full customer reviews and testimonials by embedding a shortcode into the HTML of your webpage or blog post.<\/p>\n\n<p>Features:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Customizable colors for the widget using the dropdown in the Widgets panel<\/li>\n<li>Customizable colors for the shortcode using the color attribute dark-blue, light-blue, or light-gray (Example:  [showspreviews color=\"light-gray\"])<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Superpages.com is the local business directory listing expert.
