You can easily choose between a random picture, the \"Top Of Yesterday\" picture, or a specific picture by specifying the picture ID in the widget's parameters.<\/p>\n\n<p>The widget uses a class called \"widget_airliners_widget\" allowing you to enforce some rendering, as the default block provided by Airliners.net is black with white writing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Included is airliners-widget.css style sheet that shows how to get the block with gray writing and transparent background. Feel free to edit this file to suit your needs !<\/p>\n\n<p>This widget also supports shortcodes !<\/p>\n\n<p>Just add a [airliners] shortcode to any of you posts and you'll get a random Airliners.net picture by default !\nThe shortcode supports two parameters : imgtype and imgid.\n* imgtype indicates what type of picture you want to show, it can take one of these values : random, yesterday, picture\n* imgid sets the id of the specific picture yo",
