Likewise, if you want to remove a user from all sites it is one click as well.  CAUTION: Wordpress has an optional mechanism when deleting a user from a site that will allow you to assign that users posts to another user.  I have ignored this for this release.  Please take a DB backups until you are used to this plugin and Multi-Site.<\/p>",
