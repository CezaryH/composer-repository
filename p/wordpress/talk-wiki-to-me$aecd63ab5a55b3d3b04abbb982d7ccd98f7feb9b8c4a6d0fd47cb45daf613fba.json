                "description": "<p><strong>Talk Wiki To Me<\/strong> is based on the <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/better-wiki-links\/\" title=\"Better-{{Wiki}}-Links\">Better-{{Wiki}}-Links<\/a> system. However, <strong>Talk Wiki To Me<\/strong> allows you to define more that just one custom wiki tag. This allows you the ability to define your own tags to multiple different search engines, websites, directories, or reference sites. Defining your own wiki-like tags allows you to quickly compose links that use a common url structure, allowing you to spend more of your efforts composing posts and less time creating or managing the url links. It also protects your external links from becoming broken if an external site changes their url site structure, or paths.<\/p>\n\n<p>After installation, you can find the plugin settings under Talk Wiki To Me in the Settings section.  First, select your style of brackets you want to use for your linking, by default double brackets are used.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>[[ ]], (( )), {{ }}<\/li",
