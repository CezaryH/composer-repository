This widget is fully customizable and will display a feed of images from any RSS or Atom feed provided to it.<\/p>\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n<h4>About<\/h4>\n\n<p>The widget was designed from the ground up to be both very simple to use, while also being excessively customizable. The more complicated features are hidden by default, keeping the widget customization panel simple and obvious, while more advanced customization remains available at the click of a button.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin was originally written to be compatible with Wordpress from version 2.8 and up, though it may be compatible with older versions as the amount of interaction with Wordpress is fairly minimal. Wordpress' stock version of jQuery is employed for all animations and interactions.<\/p>\n\n<p>To see a demo of Anyfeed Slideshow in use, check <a href=\"http:\/\/tixen.net\/blog\/\">the blog on the creator's site<\/a>.<\/p>",
