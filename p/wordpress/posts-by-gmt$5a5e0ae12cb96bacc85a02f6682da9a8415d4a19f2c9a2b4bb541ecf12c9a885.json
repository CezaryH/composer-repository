All it does is change the default sort order of a\nWP_Query from posts.post_date to posts.post_date_gmt -- that is, sort\non the GMT timestamp of a post rather than the local time zone.<\/p>\n\n<p>Who needs this? People who switch time zones frequently. People\nrunning a network installation of WordPress where they want to be able\nto aggregate posts from all their network blogs easily, and in the\nright order. I don't know. I wrote it for FreeThoughtBlogs.com, so\ntheir \"most recent posts\" sidebar would stop showing only posts from\na few blogs in early time zones. If it works for you, great.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have every hope that this plugin will be made obsolete by the\ndefault sort order being changed in the WordPress core. I can think of\nno good reason why comments are sorted by GMT but posts by local time.<\/p>\n\n<p>For all I know, this plugin works with older versions than 3.0. I've\nonly tested it with 3.2.1.<\/p",
