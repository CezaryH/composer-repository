It currently shares options (for easy migration) with the original Flattr plugin (by flattr.com) and FlattrWidget (by Donncha O Caoimh) such as default Flattr UID, language etc. Separate post option changes also affects these plugins, but this will change.<\/p>\n\n<p>FlattrButton is dual-licensed Affero GPL v3.0 and GPL v2.0. The source code is available by checkout from the Wordpress Plugin SVN repository:<\/p>\n\n<p>FlattrButton will not work correctly without an account on flattr.com. Having an account there means you can flattr me too.<\/p>",
