Default options are set to remove what's most commonly removed for you.<\/p>\n\n<p>This avoids the need to hack core wordpress files or your theme\/ plugin files, it also explains what options do when enabled.<\/p>\n\n<p>It lists every option and some of these you may not want to disable, if you make a serious mistake you can remove the plugin from the folder or delete the entry in the options database (wg_wphead_settings)<\/p>\n\n<p>Very basic installation, language support and additional features to be added.<\/p>",
