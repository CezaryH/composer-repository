The images can be stacked up or listed in a sidebar box, linked to the commenter's website. You can also change its behavior to display the current post commenters in a single post, also in the form of gravatar images. If your blog is powered by self-hosted WordPress version 2.8 or above, you can use this widget and place it anywhere within the sidebar of your WordPress blog. This widget should encourage your blog readers to put comments into your posts.<\/p>\n\n<p>This widget is configurable. You can specify the number of top commenters to be displayed in the list. You also can specify the gravatar width. And if you ever want to exclude someone (or yourself) from the list, just put the email addresses into the exclude list. Even more, you can specify the time frame of comments whose commenters are included in the list.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Widget<\/h4>\n\n<p>In the Appearance -&#62; Widgets in WordP",
