This data can be used by ham radio operators to determine the best time to make long-range communications on shortwave bands (160 to 10 meters). \nBut this widget required you to edit your templates and add a little javascript snippet to them.<\/p>\n\n<p>With this WordPress widget you can now add the solar widget to your blog easy and simple.<\/p>",
