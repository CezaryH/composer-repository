This plugin does not sweat to those who host \nconfidential informations, use a plugin like wp-sentry instead !<\/p>\n\n<p>It lets users login, and then redirects them back to the blog, it also shows error messages.<\/p>\n\n<p>NOTE: it is based on sidebar-login version 2.1.4 from jolley_small, thanks to his great job !<\/p>",
