Sorry to be dramatic, but due to changes to the eBay RSS feed, IT MAY STOP WORKING on June 30th 2011, or at a time not long after that! Unfortunately I do not have time to upgrade it as there are many many others things that would need improving too.<\/strong> If there is still demand for this free version then I would urge a developer to take this old version and continue its development under GNU\/GPL. As I have said, I unfortunately cannot do this. I have for some time been working on a new version which is better in every way and also compatible with the new RSS feed (and backwards compatible with the old version of Wordbay). Find out more about the new version at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewordbay.com\/\" title=\"The Word Bay\">The Word Bay<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>To recap, this plugin allows you to insert a listing of related eBay products into your Wordpress pages and posts, according to parameters defined in the admin panel.
