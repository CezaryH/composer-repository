It doesn't seem like much, and the plugin is truly non-invasive to the rest fo the WP install. But the value that this simple tool can have on the overall organization for Admins and Developers of WordPress websites is priceless.\nBy enhancing the plugin with the Pro Addon, you can easily change, add, or remove images with the Quick Edit feature, directly from your Posts List Page.<\/p>",
