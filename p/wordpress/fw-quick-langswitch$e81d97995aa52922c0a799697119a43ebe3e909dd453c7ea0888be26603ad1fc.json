This plugin only uses the locale files from wordress or buddypress and eventually your theme for user to have the interface in his language.<\/p>\n\n<p>When the user clicks on a flag, he is sent a cookie mentionning the language to use which will be destroyed when leaving his browser or updated when he clicks on another flag.<\/p>\n\n<p>It does not provide content localization features.<\/p>\n\n<p>I made this plugin as I needed my users to be able to switch from one language to another while viewing the full blog content which did not need to be localized. I had localized my theme and uploaded as many .mo language files as needed in my theme and wordpress languages directory.\nI have used this plugin on Buddypress as well.<\/p>",
