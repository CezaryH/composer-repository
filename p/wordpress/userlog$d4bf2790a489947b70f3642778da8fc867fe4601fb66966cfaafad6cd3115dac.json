I created this plugin because I could see that bots from china were trying to login to my site with the bettersecurity plugin but not if they were succesfull.<\/p>\n\n<p>This small plugin saves the time and ip address from every user that succesfully logs in on wordpress and displays them on the admin dashboard. Only administrators can acces the logs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since version 1.2 its also possible to search within the logs.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you have feedback on this plugin or problems with it (such as bugreports) please shoot me an email at <a href=\"mailto:williewonka341@gmail.com\">williewonka341@gmail.com<\/a>.<\/p>",
