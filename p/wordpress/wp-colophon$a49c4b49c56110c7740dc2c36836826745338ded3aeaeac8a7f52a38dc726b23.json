Footer spam needs to stop and this little plugin is my attempt at getting everyone to think of a better way to leave your mark.<\/p>\n\n<p>What is a Colophon? <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Colophon_%28publishing%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Colophon_%28publishing%29<\/a><\/p>",
