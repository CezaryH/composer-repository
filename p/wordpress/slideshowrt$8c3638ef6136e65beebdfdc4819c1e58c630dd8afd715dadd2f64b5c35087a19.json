Uses JQuery and JQueryCycle to transition images. Images and text handled in a simple admin area. Images in the slideshow can be associated with particular pages, so that only appropriate images are shown in particular places. Transitions can be customised if required through simple JQuery modifications, other display by CSS. Includes 'play', 'pause', 'advance' buttons. This plugin is designed to be simple, not full-featured. If you are not comfortable with a bit of JQuery and CSS editing, this is not the plugin for you.<\/p>",
