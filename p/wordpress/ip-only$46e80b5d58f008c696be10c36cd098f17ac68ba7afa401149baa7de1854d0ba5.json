I tried to write a different blog, and I found it is just impossible to maintain two. So I decided to put it on to my own personal blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>Although most of the articles are public in nature, I do have something that I hope to disclose to the general public later. I don't want to have complicated OAuth based verification. A simple IP based restriction is good enough. There is no simple solution so I wrote one myself.<\/p>",
