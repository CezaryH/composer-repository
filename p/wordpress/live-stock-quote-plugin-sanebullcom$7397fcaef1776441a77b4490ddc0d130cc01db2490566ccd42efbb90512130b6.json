All you need to do is unzip the files and upload them to your \/wp-content\/plugins\/ directory.<\/p>\n\n<p>After uploading, activate the plugin through the WP Admin -&#62; Plugins page. To use it, you will need to define the keywords in Options -&#62; SaneBull Quote.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's it! From now on, whenever you use any of the specified keywords in your posts or pages, they will automatically convert to the SaneBull Live Stock widget.<\/p>",
