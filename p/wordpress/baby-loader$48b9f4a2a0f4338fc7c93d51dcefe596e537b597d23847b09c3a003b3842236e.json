Thus I began work on the Baby Loader, a simple JavaScript to show to the world just how long before your little one shows up to change your life.<\/p>\n\n<p>This Wordpress widget lets you share your progress with the world. Give it a title, due date, and gender, and it gives you a progress bar, showing just how much longer you can expect your little bundle of joy.<\/p>",
