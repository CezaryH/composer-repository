It admits HTML code but it is not very comfortable to code in that small box, so that is the reason because some WYSIWYG widgets were created some later, you can add images, and format the text easily.<\/p>\n\n<p>But widgets are pieces of our sites intended to change some often, and it would be nice to have revisions, or upload images just for them, use shortcodes... cutting the story short, to <strong>handle widgets as they were posts<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Widget Entries plugin creates the Widget post-type in the administration area to make easier the edition of the text widgets, and also register a new widget to import the widget entries easily.<\/p>\n\n<p>This way of working has many advantages:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You can format your widget with the Wordpress editor.<\/li>\n<li>You can upload images directly to be shown in your widgets.<\/li>\n<li>You can have widgets drafts.<\/li>\n",
