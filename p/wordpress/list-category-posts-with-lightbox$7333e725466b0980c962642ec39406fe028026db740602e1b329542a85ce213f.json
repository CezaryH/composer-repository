                "description": "<p>List members posts with lightbox (with featured image) allows you to list posts from a category into a post\/page using the [catlist] shortcode.<\/p>\n\n<p>The shortcode accepts a category name or id, the order in which you want the posts to display, and the number of posts to display. You can also display the post author, date, excerpt, custom field values, even the content! The [catlist] shortcode can be used as many times as needed with different arguments on each post\/page.\n A lightbox will be popup after clicking a particular image of a post. It will display the post content regarding the featured image.\nGreat to use WordPress as a CMS, and create pages with several categories posts.<\/p>\n\n<p>&#160;If you want custom changes or styles you can contact us at <a href=\"mailto:info@opensourcetechnologies.com\">info@opensourcetechnologies.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Widget<\/strong>: It also includes a widget which works pretty much the same as the plugin. Just add as many widgets as you want, ",
