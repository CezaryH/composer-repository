WP's default sticky ordering \ncraziness is turned off by returning an empty array for the next call to\nget_option('sticky_posts') which happens in WP_Query-&#62;get_posts().<\/p>\n\n<p>There is currently a ticket awaiting review on the Wordpress trac system to roll this functionality into the Wordpress core:",
