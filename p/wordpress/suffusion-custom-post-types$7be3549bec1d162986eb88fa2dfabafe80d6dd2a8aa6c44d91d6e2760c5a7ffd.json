                "description": "<p>This plugin is an add-on to the Suffusion WordPress Theme. When Custom Post Types were introduced in WP there were no plugins to help users define the post types via a UI.\nSo the theme offered a UI as a part of its back-end to help users define post types and taxonomies. With the changing plugin landscape there are several plugins that offer\nthe capability to define custom post types, so this code is not included in the theme with effect from version 4.0.0 of Suffusion.<\/p>\n\n<p>However you might already be using this functionality within Suffusion, hence this plugin is meant to offer you the ability to edit what you have defined\nand add more to the list. Also, in case you decide to move away from Suffusion, this plugin will help you carry your custom post types to your new theme.<\/p>\n\n<p>More features will be added in the future.<\/p>",
