                "description": "<p>Ordered Thumbnails is a WordPress plugin that allows you to display thumbnails based on images that have been attached to a post. This plugin also allows you to specify which thumbnail appears next to a post with multiple images by ordering the thumbnails in the Gallery tab of the WordPress \"Add Images\" lightbox and placing the thumbnail desired in the first position.<\/p>\n\n<p>To style how the thumbnail appears on your page, you may pass optional CSS class names to the plugin, which will then be applied to the <code>&#60;img&#62;<\/code> tag returned. Alternately, by setting the display parameter to \"false\", Ordered Thumbnails will return the thumbnail URL, height, and width as a PHP array to be used however you see fit. If no images have been attached to a post, the plugin fails gracefully and returns \"false\". This plugin will work anywhere the WordPress posts loop is used and works particularly nice in combination with <code>the_excerpt<\/code> for archive pages.<\/p>",
