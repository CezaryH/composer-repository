Works out of the box, no settings, just install it and activate it.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are already good plugins in the same area, so I've looked at all of them, and built some kind of 'mega-fork&#38;mix', getting ideas and solutions from each of them.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin exists in Lite \/ Pro \/ Ultimate editions, you can find more info on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wp-ise.com\/\">WP-ISE official website<\/a>.<\/p>",
