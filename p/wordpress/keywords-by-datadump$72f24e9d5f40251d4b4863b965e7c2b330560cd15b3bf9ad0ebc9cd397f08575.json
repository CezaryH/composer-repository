The goal is to produce 6-7 short keyphrases (of one or two, or possibly three keywords each) and include them in a keywords meta tag in the document header. These keyphrases should be representative of the document's focus and content. N-gram (max n=2) analysis is used on the page content after stopword removal to build the keyword list. Dirty and simple, just the way I like it!<\/p>",
