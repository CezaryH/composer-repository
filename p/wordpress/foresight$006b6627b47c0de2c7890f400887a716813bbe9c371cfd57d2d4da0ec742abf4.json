It does this by loading a tabbed display of known\nexploits into the Wordpress administrative backend. (It's available under\n'Tools' -&#62; 'Foresight' in the admin side-bar.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Using the plugin is simple: when you log in to perform your various\nadministrative tasks, take a moment to browse through the known exploits.\nIf you see vulnerabilities in that plugins you use, take the appropriate\naction. (What's \"appropriate\" of course, will vary based off of several\nfactors, but may range from doing nothing to disabling the vulnerable\nplugin.)<\/p>",
