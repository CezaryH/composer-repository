But there&#8217;s no reason not to use it now.  All you have to do is download the widget, install it in your plug-ins folder, add it to your side bar and edit the preferences.  Enter you username, GUID, select image and enter your message.<\/p>\n\n<p>To obtain your GUID, log in to you Geocache account, go to &#8220;My Account,&#8221; then click &#8220;View My Stat Bar&#8221; (near the bottom on the right side under &#8220;Account Options&#8221;).  You&#8217;ll see some generated code in the text area there that looks something like this<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.geocaching.com\/profile\/?guid=db5629ca-06d2-4f95-8c72-bdb425934722\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>What you want to copy (and paste) is everything after &#8220;guid=&#8221; and ",
