The plugin generates a list of plugins that are not currently active on any sites or networks. It generates a separate list of plugins that are active somewhere within the installation, and provides details about where and how those plugins are activated.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin first retrieves a full list of all of the plugins that are network-activated throughout your installation. Then, it loops through all of the sites in your installation, retrieving a list of all of the active plugins on each site. Next, it runs a diff between the full list of installed plugins and the list of all active plugins.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once it retrieves all of that information, it outputs two separate lists.<\/p>\n\n<p>The first list is the list of Inactive Plugins; all plugins that are installed, but not activated anywhere within WordPress will be listed there.",
