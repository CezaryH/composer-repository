Well no need to worry about that any longer! As of today, you don&#8217;t need to mess with any of that to install ThesisReady thesis skins. The entire process is managed via the WordPress admin area on your site. Simply backup your old copy of Thesis, upload the plugin and a fresh copy of the current version of the Thesis framework, and you&#8217;re good to go. You&#8217;ll be able to log into your ThesisReady account right from your admin area and install any theme from you&#8217;ve purchased.<\/p>",
