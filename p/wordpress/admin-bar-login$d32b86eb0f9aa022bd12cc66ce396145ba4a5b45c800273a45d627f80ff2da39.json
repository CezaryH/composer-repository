This makes sense for a blog, where you're the only one that has an account.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, if you're running a site where most visitors need to be logged in before doing anything useful, you probably want to make it as easy as possible for them to log in or register.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is what this plugin is for: it shows the login form right there in the admin bar, so that users don't need to load another page just to enter their username and password.<\/p>",
