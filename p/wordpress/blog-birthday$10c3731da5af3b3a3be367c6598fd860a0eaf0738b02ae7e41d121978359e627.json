You've been around since 11 August 2008.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Happy 7th Blog Birthday! The first post on this blog was on 19 November 2004.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Happy 1st Blog Birthday! This blog was first registered on 23 July 2010.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Caveats:\n- Old WordPress admin accounts have a registration date of 0000-00-00 and never have a\n  blogger birthday. \n- Blog registration starts when you turn on WordPress multisite. If you did this, the\n  date may be off.\n- First post assumes that there a post_id=1 and uses the date off that.<\/p>",
