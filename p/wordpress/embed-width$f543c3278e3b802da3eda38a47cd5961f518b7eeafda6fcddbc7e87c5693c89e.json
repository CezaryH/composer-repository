                "description": "<p>A plugin that allows you to add a shortcode to your posts to embed your videos, or other embeddable content such as images. There are default width, height, and style settings, as well as default settings for video descriptions with styling settings. You can set universally for all of your videos which can be set on the options page. If you need one of your videos to have a different width, height, or styling you can just add tags to the shortcode that override the default settings. This Plugin supports a few different Video Types, Including (but not limited to) M4V, Quicktime, SWF, and Youtube. It works as an embedder, so basically any site that provides an Embed Code will work.<\/p>",
