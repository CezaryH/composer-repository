But keeping the list of events current is a pain. So this plugin simple displays a list of all future events.<\/p>\n\n<p>To be listed, an event must have its own post or page. To tell the plugin that the page is an event, you add a custom field (if you can't see custom fields and you're using Wordpress 2.7+, you may need to add it by selecting screen options). Add a custom field with the name event_date and the value YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. 2009-02-03 for 3rd February 2009). Then save the page.<\/p>\n\n<p>To ouput the list of events add the text [events_list] to any post or page. You can see a demo at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emw.org.uk\/events\/en\/\">Evangelical Movement of Wales<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>As I said, it's very simple. There are no options to tweak, no settings to change. But if it's what you need, you won't want to change anything!<\/p>",
