                "description": "<p><em>GPP Base Hook Widgets<\/em> is a plugin that creates new widget areas for the <a href=\"http:\/\/graphpaperpress.com\/themes\/base\/\">Base theme<\/a> by <a href=\"http:\/\/graphpaperpress.com\">Graph Paper Press<\/a> and attaches them to the theme's action hooks.  Basically, it allows you to add widgets pretty much anywhere.<\/p>\n\n<p>Typically, to add extra stuff to the theme, you must use one of <em>Base's<\/em> action hooks.  This can be quite confusing to some users.  This plugin was created mainly for those users without much PHP knowledge.  It allows them to take advantage of <em>Base's<\/em> hook system without the need to understand how it works.  Of course, even advanced users can take advantage of this, especially when dealing with client work.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is for <strong>WordPress 3.0+ only<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>You must have the <a href=\"http:\/\/graphpaperpress.com\/themes\/base\/\">Base theme<\/a> installed to use it.<\/p>",
