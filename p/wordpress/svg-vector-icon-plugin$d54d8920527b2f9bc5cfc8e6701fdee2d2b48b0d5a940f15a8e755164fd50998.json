After witnessing the power of this plugin first hand, I wanted \nto give a little something back to the community who have helped me through the years.

Meaning they will not degrade in quality the larger they get. Another\ngreat feature of this plugin is the ability to use the same icons across all devices. No need to generate Retina specific images for retina\nready devices. By setting a max-width on the icon, it then becomes responsive.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is also great for developers who use icons on multiple sites and want to avoid the hassle of re-installing\nweb",
