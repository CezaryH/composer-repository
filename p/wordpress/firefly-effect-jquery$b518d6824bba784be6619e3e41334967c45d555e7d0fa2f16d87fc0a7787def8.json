It helps direct the user's attention to certain parts of the site without overwhelming them.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've recently started seeing sites use a type of Javascript animation that is really appealing to me. It's subtle and at the same time has a huge impact on the design.<\/p>\n\n<p>And that's it, you now have floating pixels on your website.

It's incredibly easy to add to your site and can really bring the design to life.<\/p>",
