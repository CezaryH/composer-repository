This service is still in alpha phase, but I believe it will reach great features.<\/p>\n\n<p>Based on its development blog, I wrote a piece of WP plugin code to make this thing easier to use.<\/p>\n\n<p>After installed and activated, the plugin will add a \"siteous and share\" link button on your bottom of posts. You can easily convert your post URL link into short URL and share it to everyone using Siteous.<\/p>",
