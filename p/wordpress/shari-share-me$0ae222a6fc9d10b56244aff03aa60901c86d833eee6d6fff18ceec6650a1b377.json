                "description": "<p>Social network sharing is great site traffic builder but when the social network icons do not show properly\non the page to be shared, for example, when you are in a secured session like any-to-any, this can be distracting\nand you risk loosing a visitor and most importantly a valid external link to your website.<\/p>\n\n<p>Shari fixes this by putting the social network icons in a CSS file. Now the icons show in both secured and\nunsecured page sessions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Shari is picky right now and only gives you a fixed selection of the major social networks. If you are nice to her (like\noffer contributions), she may change her mind?<\/p>\n\n<p>The social networks offered include: Digg, Yahoo!, MSN Live, Facebook, Stumble, Technorati, Reddit and Newsvine<\/p>",
