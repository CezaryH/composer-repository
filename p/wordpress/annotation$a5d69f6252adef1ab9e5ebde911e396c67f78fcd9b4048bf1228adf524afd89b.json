Default functionality is provided out-of-the-box for those who require simple, yet aestechtically pleasing tooltips.  For those who need more control over the look-and-feel of the tooltip, advanced customization directives are available.  Customizations can also be applied independently to each annotation. Both text and images can be used for anchors and HTML can be used freely in content.<\/p>",
