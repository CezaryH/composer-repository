It gives the member the ability to add \"Education\", \"Professional Experience\", and \"Skills\" to their profile. It sorts the users entries by date, newest first, and allows them to delete unwanted entries. Simple to use, and follows the BuddyPress theme.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is no backend settings to configure, it's all frontend, just that simple.<\/p>",
