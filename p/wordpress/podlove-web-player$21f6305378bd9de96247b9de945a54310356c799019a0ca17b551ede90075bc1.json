See <a href=\"http:\/\/podlove.org\">podlove.org<\/a> for more information.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are basically four ways to use the Podlove Web Player:<\/p>\n\n<h3>1) as a Standalone Player<\/h3>\n\n<p>You won&#8217;t need any of the PHP or WordPress files in this package. Just stick to \"standalone.html\" and see how it&#8217;s done there. Maybe you want to build your very own CMS plugin. If so &#8211; let us know!<\/p>\n\n<h3>2) manual WordPress shortcodes<\/h3>\n\n<p>Use a simple shortcode in your posts and pages, and the Podlove Web Player will appear, playing any media file you want to assign.
