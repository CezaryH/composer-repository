The current bugs are:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It does not send out new comment\/moderation notifications at all.<\/li>\n<li>It sends out one copy of notifications generated by the Subscribe to Comments\nplugin for each person subscribed. (Fixed in trunk)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Mail Manager adds a plethora of new email notification options to WordPress\nfor multiuser blogs. Instead of notifying the blog administrator or post\nauthor of all administrative activity, you can define who gets notified of\nwhat events, allowing for specific users to handle different administrative\nactivities on a multiuser blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>Notification options include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>New comments and comments awaiting moderation<\/li>\n<li>Changes in post or page status (e.g. pending review) (future)<\/li>\n<li>Changes in user status (future)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Mail Manager is compatible with WordPress 2.0 and later and WordPress MU\n1.0 and late",
