The plugin is a tool to select a Chinese and English font stack to target  HTML heading tags (H1-H6) and the HTML body tag. This works for multi-language websites in Chinese and English and also provides an English font fallback for numbers and and English words on native Chinese sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is developed by Grafica Real, a Beijing website design and development company.<\/p>",
