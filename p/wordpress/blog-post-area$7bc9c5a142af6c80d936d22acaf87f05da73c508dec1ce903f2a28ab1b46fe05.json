It's setup to make it easy to add areas for Featured Posts, or other types of special data they want to be displayed.\n(Top 5 posts, or top 10 posts, or whatever).  Very basic functionality for now. I plan to expand it greatly based off user feature\nrequests, and new ideas that I get.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: This is the beta release.  There will be bug fixes, response to feedback, and additional development coming in the near months.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: I have added a new widget. PLEASE NOTE this is currently only a function. I have not registered it as a usable sidebar widget. This\nis coming in a near future version.<\/p>",
