Over time, this feature required a re-vamping and was rewritten from the ground up as a standalone plugin. <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/woosidebars\/\">WooSidebars<\/a>, the newly-imagined Sidebar Manager, can work with any theme that supports dynamic widget areas and is a far easier and more intuitive system.<\/p>\n\n<p>The WooSidebars Sidebar Manager Converter plugin makes it easy to transfer your custom sidebars from the old Sidebar Manager system over to use with WooSidebars, with all conditions and settings in tact.<\/p>\n\n<p>Looking for a helping hand? <a href=\"http:\/\/dojodocs.woothemes.com\/sidebar-manager-to-woosidebars-converter\/\">View plugin documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Looking to contribute code to this plugin? <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/woothemes\/woosidebars-sbm-converter\/\">Fork the repository over at GitHub<\/a>.\n(submit pull requests to the \"develop\" branch)",
