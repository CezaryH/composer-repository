Hovering over the address reveals a map that displays the post's exact location.<\/p>\n\n<p>It serves a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/GeoRSS\">GeoRSS feed<\/a> of all geotagged posts on your site, allowing geo-aware RSS readers to display the location of your post or otherwise aggregate your geotagged content.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is forked from <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/geolocation\/\">Geolocation<\/a> by <a href=\"http:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/frsh\/\">Chris Boyd<\/a> and contributors. If you don't need a GeoRSS feed then you might be better just to use the original plugin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Development work on this fork was commission",
