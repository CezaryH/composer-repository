                "description": "<p>Description: This plugin is made to use the Revolver Maps from revolvermaps.com in a sidebar widget for wordpress 3.2.1. Revolver Maps are interactive visitor globes rendered by the Revolver Engine. Every visitor leaves an eternal dot on the globe, recent visitors are tagged by the labels showing flag, city and state. The Revolver Graphics Engine is a strongly specialized 3D renderer. It's available as a Java version as well as a Flash version. The RevolverMaps Service bases on both implementations. More info: visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.revolvermaps.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.revolvermaps.com<\/a>. Width and height of the widget is 300x300 smaller versions (250x250) can be made on enough requests. All credits go to the revolver maps creators who made the actual revolver maps.\nI widgetized this program to use it on my blog and want to share it with others who might see use in it.<\/p>",
