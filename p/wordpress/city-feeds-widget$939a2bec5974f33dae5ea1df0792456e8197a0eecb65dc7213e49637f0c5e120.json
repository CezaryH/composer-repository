Your plaza information is loaded via Ajax to prevent long page loads while waiting for the \nCity to output the information. I wrote this plugin to integrate our plaza posts into our main website.  I hope it \nblesses your organization.  If you have any ideas for future releases, please email me (my address is in the plugin \ncomments).<\/p>",
