Most video plugins assume you only want to show one video on your post, so if you have multiple videos to show, they are stacked one above the other. This plugin uses shortcode notation to allow you to insert as many videos as you want into your post. Using thumbnails, a title and caption, and any additional link, the user will see a nicely formatted gallery of the available videos. Videos are shown in a lightbox dialog.<\/p>\n\n<p>Online demo: <a href=\"http:\/\/insidenorthpoint.org\/groups\/assimilation\/branding-promotion\/\" title=\"FLV Gallery on Inside North Point\">English: FLV Gallery on insidenorthpoint.org<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Dependencies: The FLV Gallery uses the following:\n    - jQuery and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ericmmartin.com\/projects\/simplemodal\/\" title=\"Simple Modal plugin\">Simple Modal plugin<\/a> by Eric Martin \n    - [JW FLV Player] (<a href=\"http",
