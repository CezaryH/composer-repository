Without Flash !<\/p>\n\n<p>It's quite experimental so far, but \"support is coming to most browsers in the next few months\". You should read <a href=\"http:\/\/johndyer.name\/native-fullscreen-javascript-api-plus-jquery-plugin\/\">John Dyer's post<\/a> about that.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin come with a widget and a shortcode to generate the button. Use a CSS selector to target the element you want to display in fullscreen... and that's it !<\/p>\n\n<p>[fullscreen target=\"THE-CSS-SELECTOR\" text=\"The button's text\"]<\/p>\n\n<p>Enjoy folks !<\/p>",
