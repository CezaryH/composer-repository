Just like what bbPress is doing for forums and BuddyPress is doing for social networks, Custom Content Portfolio is doing for portfolios.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin was created because of the rising need from users who are downloading WordPress themes with portfolio management built in (not a good idea for content portability).  I wanted users to be able to switch themes without losing their content.  This will also allow any theme developer to build a theme on top of this plugin.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you're looking for a theme that was designed specifically to work with this plugin, there's already two available from day one (with more to come):<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/themehybrid.com",
