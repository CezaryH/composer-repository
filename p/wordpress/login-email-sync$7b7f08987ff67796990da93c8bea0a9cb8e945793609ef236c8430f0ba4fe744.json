To do this, you can use a good plugin like 'WP Email Login' or you can activate a 'Register Plus Redux' plugin's option, but when the users will ask for lost password, the old \/ original username will be emailed to them, and this can cause confusion. To avoid this situation, just install and activate Login Email Sync, and it will sync the username ( user_login database field ) with the email ( user_email database field ) every time a user updates her\/his profile.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you find this plugin useful, please rate it.<\/p>",
