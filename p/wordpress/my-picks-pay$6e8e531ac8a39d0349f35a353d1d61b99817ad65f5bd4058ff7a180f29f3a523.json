Note that the video will look odd and might\nnot display properly if you change the dimensions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that the syntax is very sensitive and any slight deviations\nfrom the above format will cause it to be left as plain text\ne.g. putting quotes around the arguments, putting an '@' in ad_ID,\nor putting anything other than numbers in for width and height.<\/p>",
