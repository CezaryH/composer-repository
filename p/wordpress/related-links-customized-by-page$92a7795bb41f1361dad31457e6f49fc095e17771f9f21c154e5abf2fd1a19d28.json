Then assign each link the category name that matches the page(s) you want it to appear on.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>That will display a list of links with the class \"related-link\", and an <code>&#60;h3&#62;<\/code> with the class \"related-links-title\". You can then style them with CSS. If you want them to stack vertically, give the links the CSS property \"display:block;\".<\/p>",
