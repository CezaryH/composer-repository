A 'whisper' is a comment that is only displayed for targeted viewers. Viewers who are not authorised to view the whisper, will only see the replacement text instead.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a great plugin to use for a class blog where a classroom blog can have multiple authors where the teacher\/professor may want to add private notes for the student instead of making a public comment.<\/p>",
