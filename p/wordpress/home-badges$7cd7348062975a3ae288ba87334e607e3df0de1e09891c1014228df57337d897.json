Often for SEO purposes the page title for the home page isn't 'Home' - which can make finding it amongst the site's many pages a bit of a hassle.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Quick links<\/h4>\n\n<p>The Pages menu item has, by default, two links - All Pages and Add New. Additional links will be added if a static front page and posts page has been set, allowing users to access these pages in one click from the dashboard.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Elegant Icons<\/h4>\n\n<p>Home Badges displays elegant icons that resemble the native user interface to identify the front and posts page on the manage pages screen.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Efficient &#38; Minimal implementation<\/h4>\n\n<p>No configuration required<\/p>",
