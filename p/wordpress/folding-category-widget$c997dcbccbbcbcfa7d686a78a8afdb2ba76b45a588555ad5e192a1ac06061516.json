Eventually your categories will take up more room on your screen and scroll across many pages. I work on one blog which has over 350 categories and with this number the standard Wordpress category list is the height of three or four screens - any content below this is lost!<\/p>\n\n<p>Folding Category List for Wordpress is a plug-in that will only show the top level categories and the current sub-categories. This will save a lot of space on your sidebars for other widgets. Additionally, you can animate the menu as either a drop down horizontal menu or an accordion style vertical menu, both with cool jQuery animations.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Main Features<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>jQuery Animation: Use Suckerfish or Superfish to animate drop down menus! - js included in plugin, just activate from control panel!<\/li>\n<li>jQuery Animation: Use Simple jQuery Accordion to animate vertical menus! - js included in",
