I personally found it tiresome to click through to the plugin and theme management area of my network admin as often as I do, and wanted to speed up the process.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin adds four links to the admin bar as a drop down, allowing 1 click access to add &#38; manage network plugins &#38; themes from anywhere in your network.<\/p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Only super admins will see these shortcuts.<\/p>",
