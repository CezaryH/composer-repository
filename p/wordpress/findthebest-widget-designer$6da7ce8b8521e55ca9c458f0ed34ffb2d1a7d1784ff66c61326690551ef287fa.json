We present the facts in easy-to-use format with smart filters, so that you can decide what is best.<\/p>\n\n<p>Too often, marketers and pay-to-play sites team up to present carefully crafted advertisements as objective \"best of\" lists. As a result, it has become difficult and time consuming to distinguish objective information from paid placements. Our goal is to become a trusted source in assisting you in life's important decisions.<\/p>\n\n<p>FindTheBest&#8217;s WordPress plugin enables data-driven publishers and bloggers to easily add interactive, customizable and unbiased product, service and reference listings to their own blogs and websites.<\/p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to the TechCrunch Development team.<\/p>",
