You can use it if you need to support legacy browsers, but modern web sites should be using the <code>text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;<\/code> declaration in their CSS to encourage context-sensitive kerning and the use of ligatures.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Chip Cullen's <a href=\"http:\/\/chipcullen.com\/ligatures\/\">Ligatures.js<\/a> plugin for jQuery is an extremely lightweight tool automatically inserting ligatures in content where appropriate. Ligatures are glyphs that combine two letter forms into one for stylistic and legibility reasons.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since it depends on fonts for ligature rendering, it's limited to the four ligatures that are reliably supported: fi, fl, AE, and ae.<\/p>\n\n<p>The configuration screen lets you pick which text on your site gets ligatures using CSS selectors. Use this plugin to enhance readability in headlines and flavor text on your site.<\/p>",
