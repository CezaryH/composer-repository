Borrows code from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kriesi.at\/archives\/improve-your-wordpress-navigation-menu-output\">here<\/a> as well (for the walker class rewrite). No guarantees of fitness for anything, I just couldn't find a plugin to do this simple thing so made one myself. Hope you like it. Note: Make sure descriptions are enabled in the screen options of your Menus admin, then edit to suit under each menu item. Add the widget and voila.<\/p>",
