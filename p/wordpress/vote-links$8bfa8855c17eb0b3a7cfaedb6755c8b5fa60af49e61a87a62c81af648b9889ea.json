DO NOT DOWNLOAD<\/p>\n\n<p>DO NOT DOWNLOAD<\/p>\n\n<p>You have now been told<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a very basic plugin (but not quite as basic as the previous one)<\/p>\n\n<p>It aims to provide a way to vote \"for', \"against\" or \"Abstain\" on a particular subject \/ statement.<\/p>\n\n<p>It revolves around a table in the database that has 6 Fields: Id, Title, For, Against, Abstain, Is_Active<\/p>\n\n<p>The basic functionality is that you press a link in the post\/page, and then it registers your vote in the table, and re-graphs the results using the google charts API, as well as setting a cookie so you can't vote again.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the backend is a table like the posts table, that shows all the content of the table. You can edit only the fields \"title\" and \"is_active\" but not the votes count. you can also view the results from the backend, and delete the votes<\/p>\n\n<p>Any help would be appreciated. please may you reply here if you would like to. my main problem is lack of php knowledge",
