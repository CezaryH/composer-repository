                "description": "<p>WordPress has a wonderful editing model with its \"draft workflow\", where writers can save unpublished drafts, preview posts, submit drafts for review from a superior, and even schedule a post's publication. This is all that most writers and teams ever needed for a blog. WordPress has extended beyond blogs, and has grown to be the preferred platform for any person or team writing for the web. While WordPress has evolved, its editing model has not, and this editing model is limited. Once a post is published, edits cannot follow the same workflow. That's where this plugin comes in. This plugin has two powerful features, the ability to clone posts and the ability to replace posts with another, which combined, allow writers to leverage core's \"draft workflow\" for published posts.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Create clones of existing posts.<\/em> The replicas are created as drafts, and have all the same data (including terms and post meta) as the original post. The only things not",
