'Walk' into any WooCommerce store page and what does your customer \/ client see - an almost entirely random display of products sorted mostly by date of publishing.  That has always seemed crazy to us. What shop owner would just keep stacking new stock at the front of all the other stock in their shop in any order. None is the answer! So why is that exactly what all of our virtual WooCommerce stores do?<\/p>\n\n<p>We decided to build a plugin that would fix that. With WooCommerce Product Sort and Display installed you can:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sort products to show by category on shop page.<\/li>\n<li>Sort category order by drag and drop.<\/li>\n<li>Set the number of products to show per category with link to view all.<\/li>\n<li>Set to auto show all current 'On Sale' products first in each category.<\/li>\n<li>Set to auto show all 'featured' products in each category.<\/li>\n<li",
