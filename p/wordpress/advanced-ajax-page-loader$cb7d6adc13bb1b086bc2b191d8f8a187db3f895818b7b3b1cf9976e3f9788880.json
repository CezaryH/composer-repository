It will also update the URL bar with the url the user would have been going to without AJAX, this means the user can copy the url or bookmark it and return to the page they were visiting! This plugin will also add the page to there history for even more usability!<\/p>\n\n<p>If this has helped you and saved you time please consider a donation via PayPal to:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:dt_8792@yahoo.co.uk\">dt_8792@yahoo.co.uk<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Many thanks to Luke Howell, author of the original plugin which motivated me to re-write it and extend it to what it is today.<\/p>",
