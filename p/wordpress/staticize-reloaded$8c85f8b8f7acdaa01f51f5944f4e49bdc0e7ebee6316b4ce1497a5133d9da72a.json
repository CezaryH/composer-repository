                "description": "<p>Staticize Reloaded is a plugin to make your site faster by caching the output of some WordPress pages. It creates a unique key based on the page variables and user and then if a request is made with identical variables it serves the request from a static file rather than building the page from the database. When a post is updated or a comment is left the cache is cleared. It is ideal for sites with a lot of anonymous reads and not too many updates. (For example, during a Slashdotting.)<\/p>",
