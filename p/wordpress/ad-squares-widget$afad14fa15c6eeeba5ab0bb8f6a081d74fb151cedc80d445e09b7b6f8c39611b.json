                "description": "<p>This widget makes it possible for you to display 125x125 ad squares ( or some other configurable size ) into a widget-ready bar for WordPress&#174;. You can have just 2 squares, or as many as 8 running together. It also supports multi-widget options. So technically you could have even more than 8 if you add it to a bar more than once. Each ad square accepts any HTML\/JavaScript code, so it will work with standard affiliate ads, or even with ad network codes. You can also configure the widget to shuffle the positioning of your squares if you like.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Ad Squares widget supports embedded PHP code too. If you know a little PHP scripting, you could add conditionals to the code that you place into this widget. For example, if you wanted to show different ads based on the category that is currently being displayed on your blog, you could do something like this:<!--more--><\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&#60;?php if(is_category(\"green-lizards\")): ?&#62;\n\n  insert green lizard ad campaign here\n\n&#6",
