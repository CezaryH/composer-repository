It creates a meta box on the edit post screen in the admin with two input boxes for adding your custom classes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Custom post classes are added whenever your theme calls the <code>post_class()<\/code> function, which is generally whenever a post is shown.  Custom body classes are added on the single view of the post whenever your theme calls the <code>body_class()<\/code> function.<\/p>",
