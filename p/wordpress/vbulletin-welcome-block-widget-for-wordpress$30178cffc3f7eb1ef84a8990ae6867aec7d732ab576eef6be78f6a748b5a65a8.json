If the user is not logged in they will see a login form and stats including new posts count.<\/p>\n\n<p>It works great along side the 'vbulletin\/wordpress bridge' plugin for that bit of extra integration. Now members can login from a wordpress page.<\/p>\n\n<p>Send feature suggestions or bug to: <a href=\"mailto:bugs@whatsuplift.net\">bugs@whatsuplift.net<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Known bugs:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>vBulletin 4 support may still be sketchy.<\/li>\n<\/ol>",
