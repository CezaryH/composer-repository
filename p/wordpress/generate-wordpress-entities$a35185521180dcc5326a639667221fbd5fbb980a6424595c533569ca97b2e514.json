To exclude timeout error you may change execution limit for php scripts in your php.ini.<\/p>\n\n<p>Post custom meta fields generator added in 1.4, now you can generate anything you want.<\/p>\n\n<p>Notice: when you deleting content fron GWE page, all content will be deleted rather than fake. Please add real content just after you finish your work and deleted all fake content. Thanks @soragrey for feedback.<\/p",
