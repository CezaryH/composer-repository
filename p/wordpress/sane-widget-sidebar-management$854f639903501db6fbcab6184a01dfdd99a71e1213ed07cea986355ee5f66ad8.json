Gone are the days of trying to drag a new widget from the left column to a sidebar at the bottom of the right column (ugh!).<\/p>\n\n<p>There is no configuration for this plugin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Contribute on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/WebDevStudios\/Sane-Widget-Sidebar-Management\">github<\/a>.<\/p>",
