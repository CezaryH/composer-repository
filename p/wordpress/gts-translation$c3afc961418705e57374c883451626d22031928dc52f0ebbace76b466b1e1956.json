Your blog content is initially translated by our translation server. The content is then post-edited by human translators through our online editing system. You can use the GTS community of translators, or you can assign the post-editing to your own community of translators to maintain complete control of the process.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you use the GTS Translation plugin, translated content is cached in your Wordpress database and indexed by search engines. This will increase the traffic to your website and grow your international readership.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Guaranteed to increase your traffic by at least 30% after 2 months; some customers have seen over 100% increase in traffic<\/li>\n<li>Supports over 30 languages<\/li>\n<li>Uses private, secure translation server<\/li>\n<li>Publish translated content immediatel",
