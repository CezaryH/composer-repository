People with Javascript eneabled can click on the MP3 name and it will start playing in the browser.<\/p>\n\n<p>Upload MP3's to a folder on your server. Tell the plugin where the folder is. Add the widget to your sidebar. Voila, you have a playable list of MP3's in your sidebar. Add and remove MP3's whenever you want.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin uses the amazing SoundManager2 Javascript - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.schillmania.com\/projects\/soundmanager2\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.schillmania.com\/projects\/soundmanager2\/<\/a> - refer to that site for styling).<\/p>\n\n<p>Underscores in your file names will be replaced by spaces to make them read nicely. So \"Artist_name-name_of_track.mp3\" will display as \"Artist name-name of track\".<\/p>",
