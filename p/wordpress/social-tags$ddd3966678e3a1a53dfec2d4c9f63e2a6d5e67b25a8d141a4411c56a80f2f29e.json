Titles are likened to newpaper headlines, while categories are likened to the sections of a newspaper (Sports, Finance, etc.).  Tags are where blogs are different than their printed counterparts.  They allow the readers to easily find other articles related to a specific topic, within the blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>Today, hashtags do the same as tags across our favorite social networks, creating topical conversations across the internet.  By converting your blogs tags into hashtags, you give your readers the opportunity to see what others are saying about a topic, outside of the confines of your blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>Give your tags social skills!<\/p>",
