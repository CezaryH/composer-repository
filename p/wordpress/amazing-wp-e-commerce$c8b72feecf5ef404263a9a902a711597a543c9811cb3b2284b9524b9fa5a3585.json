Those settings are: Products per row, Show only images, Display Variations, Display Description, Display \"Add to Cart\" Button, Display \"More Detail\" Button.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you have ever looked into wpsc-single_product.php file then you probably have noticed the Gold Cart plugin function in there and it does nothing. Well, I have added functionality for it. With this plugin installed, you will see additional product thumbails under the main thumbnail (screenshot 1).<\/p>\n\n<p>Also it comes with a fancy extra feature: Extra Thumbnails. If your product has more than the featured image, then you can go to products page (catalog) and hover over the product thumbn",
