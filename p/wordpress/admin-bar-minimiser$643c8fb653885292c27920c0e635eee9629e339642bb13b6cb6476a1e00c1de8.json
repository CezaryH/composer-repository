Well, if you have used a beta version of WordPress 3.1 you will know that on the front end of your blog pages you now have displayed, by default, an admin bar. This gives you a menu full of quick links to your WordPress admin panel. A lot of users don't seem to like the admin panel displayed at the top of every page, and so seek ways to disable it or remove it.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can easily disable it on a per user basis via a users profile page, but this is not that useful if you want to remove it site-wide. The Admin Bar Minimiser Plugin was written to help users keep the admin bar active but be able to minimise it at any time to make it less obtrusive.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can see a video demo of the Plugin here:<\/p>\n",
