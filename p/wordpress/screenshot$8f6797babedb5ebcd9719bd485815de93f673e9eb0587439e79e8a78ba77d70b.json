It really is that simple.<\/p>\n\n<p>With the set up as it is, the screenshots will be stored on our server and updated on a regular basis. To see the plugin in action just check out our techblog <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wscreative.co.uk\/blog\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.wscreative.co.uk\/blog\/<\/a><\/p>",
