A good example would be your sidebar bio, footer copyright notice or a simple events listing. It's not intended to be tied in with posts and pages like some other plugins.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here's what you need to know:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>WP-Blocks can be accessed via the Settings menu in the WordPress admin (I may move this in time)<\/li>\n<li>The plugin requires PHP5 (apologies to those on PHP4)<\/li>\n<li>I have developed and tested this plugin on WordPress Version 3.0 and above<\/li>\n<li>It \"should\" work on earlier versions, as far as I know I haven't used any brand spanking new API calls<\/li>\n<li>Every \"block\", whether visible or not will incur a database query so use of a caching plugin is encouraged<\/li>\n<\/ul>",
