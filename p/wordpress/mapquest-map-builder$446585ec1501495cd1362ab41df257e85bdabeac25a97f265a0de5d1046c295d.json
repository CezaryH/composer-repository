                "description": "<p>MapQuest Map Builder is a quick, easy tool for adding maps to your WordPress posts or pages.  With Map Builder you can easily add locations to the map via search, enter lat\/long coordinates, or drop points directly on the map.<\/p>\n\n<p>For each point added to the map, you can customize the map pointer icon, title and description.  You can even use custom images that you host as the map pin.  You can format text inside the descriptions as well as add images and videos to the pin descriptions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Map Builder also has tools for drawing lines and shapes on your map.  Create lines, rectangles, ellipses, and custom polygons on the map and set the color, opacity, border color and border width for each polygon on the map.<\/p>\n\n<p>MapQuest Map Builder inserts a map as either an embedded interactive map in an iframe or can also insert as a static image file.<\/p>\n\n<p>No API key or other sign-up required.  Start making maps instantly!<\/p>\n\n<p>Read more at <a href=\"http:\/\/features.mapquest.c",
