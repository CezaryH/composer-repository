Our latest tools allow you to display on your blog the origins of your incoming links, an automatic blogroll based on your exchanges with other bloggers, and also the tags corresponding to each of your articles.<\/p>\n\n<p>Let's begin by introducing the first of these tools: the Backlinks Widget.<\/p>\n\n<p>This widget allows you to display in your sidebar articles on other blogs that have cited you. It is automatic, so you need only install it and that's it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The simplified interface will allow you to personalize all your Wikio tools without any technical know-how at all.<\/p>\n\n<p>Important: This plugin is still in BETA TESTING.<\/p>",
