You can select who sees your posts (only non-registered people, or whatever level of registered user for your site) so you can keep certain things for only people who are members, or you can show ads only to non-registered visitors. You can now also run php code from the news area, so audio or video players can now be run without any other plugin. You can now add the news area to a post or page and also run php code there. You can set start and end dates for all news posts. The Plugin is now fully XHTML compliant.\nPart of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.AWSOM.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.AWSOM.org<\/a> series of Wordpress Plugins developed by Harknell, webmaster of the Webcomic at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.onezumi.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.onezumi.com<\/a><\/p>",
