I would be glad to provide access to the plugin repository. Preferably someone who has experience with the WP and WP multisite APIs (primarily their authorization and options APIs).<\/p>\n\n<h4>What is HappyCaptcha?<\/h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/happycaptcha.com\/\" title=\"HappyCaptcha\">HappyCaptcha<\/a> is an anti-spam method. Instead of randomly generating useless characters which users grow tired of continuosly typing in, risking the possibility that spammers will eventually write sophisticated spam bots which use <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Optical_character_recognition\" title=\"Optical Character Recognition - Wikipedia\">OCR<\/a> libraries to read the characters, HappyCaptcha uses a different approach.<\/p>\n\n<p>HappyCaptcha is probably the most popular and widely accepted HINT-CHALLENGE-RESPONSE CAPTCHA systems",
