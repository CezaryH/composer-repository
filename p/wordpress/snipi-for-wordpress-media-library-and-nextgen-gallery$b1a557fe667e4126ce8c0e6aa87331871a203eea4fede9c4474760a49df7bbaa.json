The current version of the Snipi WordPress Plugin gives you the option of having an entire list of images or a single image at a time sent to WordPress' Media Library or NextGen Gallery.  Within seconds after dragging an image into the Snipi Toolbar, the image will automatically appear in WordPress, ready for you to use in your posts.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Snipi WordPress Plugin has two modes, WordPress mode or NGG mode.  If you are an NextGen Gallery user, you can choose NGG mode to have images sent to NextGen Gallery rather than the WordPr",
