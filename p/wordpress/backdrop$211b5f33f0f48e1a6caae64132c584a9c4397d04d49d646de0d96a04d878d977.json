What can backdrop do that the default can't? I'm glad you asked...<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>More than just boring backgrounds, flexible backgrounds and parallex backgrounds are stuffed in here too (don't worry, the boring ones are still around as well).<\/li>\n<li>Options, options, options! More options that you can shake a well sharpened stick at.<\/li>\n<li>Who said background had to scroll up when you scroll down, make it left right, or even up and to the right if you want.<\/li>\n<li>One click retina backgrounds, make it look all purdy on that fancy screen.<\/li>\n<li>Theme schmeme, we don't need support in your stinkin theme, backdrop can (and sometimes has to) force it's way into nearly any theme.<\/li>\n<li>Built with efficiency in mind, adds only what it needs to work, and uses cachable styles and script automagically generated by the plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><em>Note: Backd",
