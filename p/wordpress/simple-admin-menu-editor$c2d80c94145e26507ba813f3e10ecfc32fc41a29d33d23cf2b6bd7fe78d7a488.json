Or setting up a WordPress install for a client, and want to get rid of the stuff they don&#8217;t use, or would screw up if they could?<\/p>\n\n<p>Us too. So we made this handy little plugin that gives you little checkboxes next to each menu item and sub-menu item, even for other plugins! Just uncheck the items you don&#8217;t want to see anymore, and they&#8217;re gone! When you need them again, just recheck and they&#8217;re back! No editing core files, and being over-written upon upgrade.<\/p>",
