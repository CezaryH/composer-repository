They keep calling and email you on the same damn things. \"What width should i make\nimages to have them fit full page, what is the link for the google docs, what are your drop box emails, where is the\nlogo for the site kept?\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Dash Note provides a dashboard widget with full editor capability to keep users up to date. Almost as if a MOTD for the\ndash board.  Hmm, that would have been a good name.<\/p>\n\n<p>When activated there is a \"Dash Note\" link on the Dashboard menu. This link takes you to the WYSIWYG editor with not one\nbut TWO SAVE BUTTONS!<\/p>",
