                "description": "<p>Many websites use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) service for their library data, such as images. These images then load from a CDN server and optimize the site\/blog's performance.\nWhen you start using a CDN service, you have to update URLs of all your images, for example if the previous URL was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.your-site.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.your-site.com\/<\/a> it should now be converted to <a href=\"http:\/\/cdn.your-site.com\/image.jpg...\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/cdn.your-site.com\/image.jpg...<\/a>. jeez, changing URLs of all your images sounds like a hectic task, doesn't it? Thanks to the latest plugin we have made for you, it is not a major task at all.\non disabling the plugin your image urls will be reverted back to your default site links.\nNote: The image URL rewrites works only inside the post content and can be undone anytime by disabling the plugin.\nThis plugin is powered by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.designzzz.com\/\" title=\"Wordpress Tutorials and Resources\">Designzzz<\/a><",
