Once you click on the author name the hidden div will show up together with the author details (taken from author profile page) plus the gravatar photo if the author has one, as well as a link to the author's BuddyPress profile. If not, the default gravatar photo would be used.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a refinement of Igor Penjivrag's Author Exposed plugin, released in 2008.  See <a href=\"http:\/\/colorlightstudio.com\/2008\/03\/14\/wordpress-plugin-author-exposed\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/colorlightstudio.com\/2008\/03\/14\/wordpress-plugin-author-exposed\/<\/a> for that plugin.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin was developed specifically for use with WordPress MU and BuddyPress.  It will work with Wordpress, but the author link (my main point of interest) won't be operable.  That may change in a future version\/adaptation of the plugin.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Comes with separate css file for easie",
