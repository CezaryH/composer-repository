This plugin allows you to set Free Shipping by Product Shipping Class, so that other products in your catalog can have shipping costs as well.\nThis free shipping is only active if the items in the cart are ALL in this shipping class. Otherwise, your normal shipping methods apply. \nYou can see this in the screenshots - as soon as the product that is not in the Digital Free Shipping class (My Boxed Item) is added, the option for free shipping disappears.<\/p>",
