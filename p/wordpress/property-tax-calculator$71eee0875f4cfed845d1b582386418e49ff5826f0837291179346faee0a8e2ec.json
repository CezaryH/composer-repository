                "description": "<p>This is a simple calculator used for defining where your money is going to. While originally being built towards Property Tax, it can work for anything really. Create as many fields as you like, defining what percentage of $$ is going towards that item.<\/p>\n\n<p>Maybe your website is requesting donations, and to help motivate people you'd like to show them how their money would be spent. Or perhaps you'd like to gear this towards some training session or upcoming event, you could use this to help people willing to spend X hours to see how much time they'll be spending at each course. Or maybe you'd like to use this widget for its original purpose, and allow people to see where their tax dollars are being spent. Either way, if you need some sort of money\/time calculator on your website, this is a great free utility!<\/p>",
