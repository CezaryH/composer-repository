The shortcode for this plugin's operation is 'infopopup'.<\/p>\n\n<p>You may create as many popups and associated targets as you like, each distinguished by a unique 'tag'. A popup with the tag 'firstpopup' can be included in any page by using the plugin's shortcode followed by a colon (:) and the tag, so:<\/p>\n\n<p>[infopopup:firstpopup]<\/p>\n\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:<\/p>\n\n<p>To get started, enable the plugin and go to Settings &#62; InfoPopup.<\/p>\n\n<p>You will see an empty table, where popups you create will be listed. Begin by clicking the 'Add new' button.<\/p>\n\n<p>Use the 'Create new InfoPopup' page to specify how your popup will work:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Shortcode tag\nThis is how your popup is uniquely identified, and as the field label suggests, the tag will be appended to the shortcode 'infopopup' within your page.
