                "description": "<p>This is a very very simple modification of the default recent comments widget.  All this does is to display recent commentERS instead of recent comments.  In other words, it just displays the names, without the \"...on name-of-the-post\" that is there by default.  You can choose whether or not you want the name to have a link, and what it will link to, if there is anything.  Works fine in WPMU.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you like it and feel you really would like to give some money, please send a donation to the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill ( <a href=\"http:\/\/nami.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/nami.org<\/a> ) or a charity of your choice.<\/p>",
