That's it.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can use it to sell any type of product\/s on your website. There is no cart, checkout process or anything complicated - it just lets the user buy a single product in 1 click, then returns them to a URL of your choice, and emails them the auto-responder.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Example Usage<\/h4>\n\n<p>Let's say you're selling an eBook. User clicks \"Buy\" button &#62; user is directed through PayPal checkout &#62; once checkout it completed user is returned to a thank you URL and emailed the eBook.<\/p>\n\n<p>I developed this plugin for a usage similar to above example. I didn't want a fully fledged eCommerce system, and many other solutions include Add to Cart and then whole heap of other stop screens that hindered the transaction.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Key Features<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Simple, light-weight PayPal plugin<\/li>\n<li>Can handle multiple prod",
