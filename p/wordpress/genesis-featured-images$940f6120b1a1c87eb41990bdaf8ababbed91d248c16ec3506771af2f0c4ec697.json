These default images will only appear any time a post, page or any custom post type does not have a featured image, or an image inside the post. So for those who write a lot of posts and want one image for the majority of your posts, this plugin works perfectly! Genesis Featured Images filters genesis_get_image() so anywhere you utilize genesis_get_image(), this plugin will provide a fallback option.  Genesis Featured Images uses the WordPress Image Uploader and Library to upload the image to ensure that the proper thumbnails are created.<\/p>\n\n<p>IMPORTANT: \n<strong>You must have <a href=\"http:\/\/wpsmith.net\/get-genesis\" title=\"Learn more about Genesis\">Genesis<\/a> installed.
