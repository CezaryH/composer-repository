This includes hiding the step for choosing avatars when creating groups or user accounts, and removing the menu items for editing avatars. This gives a more consistent (avatar-free) user experience than simply turning off the display with CSS alone. There is also the option to remove the icons in the user menus and activity filters.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please let me know if you find any bugs, or if there are tweaks needed.
