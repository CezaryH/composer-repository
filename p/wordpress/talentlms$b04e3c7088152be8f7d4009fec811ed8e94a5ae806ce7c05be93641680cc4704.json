With TalentLMS we wanted to create a better learning experience in every way that actually matters &#8211; and we are excited about this new offering. The product focuses on small but growing organizations. There are a number of obstacles that prohibit small organizations from using elearning. To be productive, small businesses need a number of tools and several related services such as setup and maintenance, course creation and the support of end-users. All these require ample time, resources and money. It comes as no surprise that most small organizations find elearning a non-viable pursuit and prefer on-job or informal training methods.<\/p>\n\n<p>Read more about TalentLMS in:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.talentlms.com\/talentlms-an-introduction\/\" title=\"TalentLMS - an Introduction\">Talen",
