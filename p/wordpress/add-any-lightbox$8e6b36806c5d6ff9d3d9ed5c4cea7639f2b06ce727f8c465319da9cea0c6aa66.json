This can then be used with any of the popular \nlightbox plugins.<\/p>\n\n<p>This does not include Javascript files for any lightbox plugins, these should be included yourself via your theme.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can group images for each post by adding [id] into your rel or class and you can also add a custom attribute to \nlinked Flash files (swf and flv).<\/p>\n\n<p>Any problems please <a href=\"http:\/\/jamiedust.net\" title=\"Jamie Dust\">get in touch<\/a><\/p>",
