It simply adds a widget for your registered and logged in users to invite friends by their's e-mail-address. This widget requires an installation of <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/wp-invites\/\">WP-Invites<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The widget is very simple. The only thing the users will have to do is to write one or more email addresses in the a textfield. The plugin will do the rest. This is how it is done:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The user adds one or more email addresses in the textfield.<\/li>\n<li>The form is sent through an ajax request to the server.<\/li>\n<li>The plugin loads the WP-Invites plugin and makes one invitation code.<\/li>\n<li>The invitation code, the inviter&#8217;s username and email address are added into the invitation email.<\/li>\n<li>A message is sent back to the widget informing the user that the email has successfully been sent.<\/",
