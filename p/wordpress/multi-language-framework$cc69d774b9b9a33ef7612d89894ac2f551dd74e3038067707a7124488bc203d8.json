When the theme outputs the content of a post, it gets filtered and displays only one language. Appart from that, this is an excelent plugin. But I junt cant sleep well at night knowing my database is like this...<\/p>\n\n<p>WPML -&#62; creates a lot of extra tables in a complex database structure and is associated with a translating service. In the top of that, the plugin does a lot more than juts adding the multi language support and claims itself as a cms solution for wordpress... I like plugin that do only one thing very well done.<\/p>\n",
