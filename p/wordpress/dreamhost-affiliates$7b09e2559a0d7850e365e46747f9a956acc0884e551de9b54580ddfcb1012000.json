All you have to do is insert your unique referral link (and a coupon if you have one) and select the type of banner you want to display. Then, drag and drop the 'Dreamhost Affiliate' widget to any widgeted area, or enter the shortcode [dreamer] on a post or page. If you're not already a DreamHost affiliate you can sign up via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dreamhost.com\/r.cgi?1364779\/hosting-rewards.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.dreamhost.com\/r.cgi?1364779\/hosting-rewards.html<\/a> (affiliate) or get a 50% discount <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dreamhost.com\/r.cgi?1364779\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.dreamhost.com\/r.cgi?1364779<\/a> on hosting at DreamHost with coupon code 'wpdreamer'. Yes, these are affiliate links. That's how I can fund such a great project without asking you for donations. :)<\/p>",
