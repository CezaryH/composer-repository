There are far better solutions \nto automatic uploads in WordPress at this time. I plan to release a version of the \nAndroid app which doesn't require a plugin to work at some time in the future.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thank you all for downloading and using, and by all means if you can still use this, \nenjoy!<\/p>\n\n<p>That being said - This is a very basic plugin, intended to add your uploads directly to your \nMedia Library for easy publishing. No more moving files around from phones \nand cameras in order to publish them. Simply batch upload or use the WordPress \nAutoMedia plugin for Android powered phones (iPhone App and Microsoft Phone \nApp coming soon!)<\/p>\n\n<p>Download the Android App at <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.vedstudio.wpam\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.vedstudio.wpam<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>See also <a ",
