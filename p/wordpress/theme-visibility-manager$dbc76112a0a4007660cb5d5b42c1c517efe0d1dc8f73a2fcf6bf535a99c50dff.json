Themes can be made hidden or visible on a blog by blog basis (through the themes menu) or on a site-wide basis through the 'Theme Visibility Manager' page in the Super Admin menu.<\/p>\n\n<p>Themes can be active even if they are invisible, but this can only be controlled by Super Admins. Blog administrators only have control over visible themes.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you find this theme useful, you might also like the Plugin Visibility Manager.<\/p>",
