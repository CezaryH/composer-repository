This plugin is labelled alpha and is feature-limited at the moment.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are future features planned for this including WordPress admin integration and options, but I felt it was important to make an alpha release.\nThis plugin is not supported in its current state, though feature ideas and feedback are welcome. This has been tested on WP 2.1 and development versions of WP but I see no reason why it would not be compatible in earlier versions.<\/p>",
