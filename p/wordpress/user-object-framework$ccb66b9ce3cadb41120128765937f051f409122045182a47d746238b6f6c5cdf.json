Relationships between a user (logged-in or IP) are created and added to the relationship\ntable; metadata (ex. votes, flags, and ratings) is attached to that particular relationship\nvia the metadata table. This is a framework; it is intended for use in voting, flagging,\nand similar user applications where a user-affiliated metadata is attached to an object.\nSupported object tables include wp_posts, wp_comments, wp_users, and wp_bp_activity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Functions are provided to add\/get\/delete relationships; metadata is added via the native WordPress\nmetadata-handling functions.<\/p>",
