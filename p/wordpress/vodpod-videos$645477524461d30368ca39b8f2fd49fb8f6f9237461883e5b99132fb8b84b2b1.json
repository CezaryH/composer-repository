Playback of the video occurs in the widget, on your blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can set up your gallery so that it displays the most recent videos you've collected, or a more specific selection of videos, arranged in a specific order.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/vodpod.com\/site\/blog_badges\" title=\"Widget examples\">Examples<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Also be sure to checkout the <a href=\"http:\/\/vodpod.com\/wordpress\">Wordpress video extension for Firefox<\/a>, which is powered by Vodpod, and makes it a snap to add videos to your blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to Alex King at <a href=\"http:\/\/crowdfavorite.com\">Crowd Favorite<\/a> for creating the Gallery and Horizontal portions of the plugin!<\/p>",
