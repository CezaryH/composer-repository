However, there are a lot of features to explore.\nFor example, if you want the same post or page to display a different repository for each user viewing it, you can add a command option specifying that the repository should be user-dependent.\nYou achieve this by simply writing: [wpfib repo='USERBOUND'] inside the post or page. This will create a separate folder for each user from the same post or page.<\/p>\n\n<p>As an example, this arrangement is useful if you intend to provide file access in a school website, where pupils can access their own repository where to upload homework and download co",
