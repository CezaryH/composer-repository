The use case for this is: WP is used to show clients creative documents, a single post is dedicated to a single project. Each revision is appended to the post. Adding in the CJ Revision Feedback tag will allow clients to provide feedback for a specific revision. Admin users can mark the feedback as completed and approved while adding sub-comments, and close out feedback on a revision. The plugin includes multiple customizable elements including: look and feel, email notifications, and post-specific email notifications.<\/p>\n\n<p>Developed on version 2.8.6 so any previous versions haven't been tested<\/p>",
