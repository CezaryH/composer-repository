No addional HTTP requests\n2. No addional DNS requests\n3. No external ressources required (like JavaScript or CSS from the social network sites)\n4. No addional JavaScript (just an inline eventhandler to open a popup if you want)\n5. No addional CSS\n6. No iframes (which would load a complete external site including a lot of HTTP &#38; DNS requests, external ressources, etc.)\n7. No privacy issues (iframes or JavaScript buttons read the login-cookies of the social network sites and allow them to trace the users surf behavior)\n8. Just plain HTML",
