You can check or uncheck the option for each post.<\/p>\n\n<p>You souldn't mark too many posts as standout (or your tags get less recognized by Google). To help you with that, this plugin shows you each post tagged within the last 7 days.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin was developed for our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gameplorer.de\">Casual Games Blog<\/a>. I hope it will help you too.\nFor further information about standout content, please see the official post:\n<a href=\"http:\/\/googlenewsblog.blogspot.com\/2011\/09\/recognizing-publishers-standout-content.html\">http:\/\/googlenewsblog.blogspot.com2011\/09\/recognizing-publishers-standout-content.html<\/a><\/p>",
