When a user clicks on an item it will redirect him to user's blog URI (subdomain).<\/p>\n\n<p>The admin can add Multiple user blogs to display as \"Featured user blogs list\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Sometimes the site owner wants to make some specific user blogs highlighted on their wordpress MU site. this is a solution for those. It does not display recent user blogs or popular user blogs ordered by ASC or DESC.<\/p>\n\n<p>It simply displays specific user blogs that were selected by the admin from the admin panel. it creates a tab \"Featured Blog \" in Settings\/Options panel in admin to manage the user blogs selection and add widget to the sidebar.<\/p>",
