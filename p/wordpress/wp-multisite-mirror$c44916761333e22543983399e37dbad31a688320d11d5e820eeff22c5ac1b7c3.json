Posting on 1 site will update all other mirrors of it.<\/p>\n\n<p>I originally put this together for a website that has 2 near identical versions, one paid and one free, both are WP Multisite installation with multiple subsites. I'm posting it here so it can be useful for other developers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some requirements:\n* The destination site and the site being mirrored must be in the same database.\n* Requires some working knowledge of WP database and WP in general (to use this and be able to mod it to your needs).<\/p>\n\n<p>Git repository:\n<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/kien\/wordpress-multisites-mirror\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/github.com\/kien\/wordpress-multisites-mirror<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Issues tracker:\n<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/kien\/wordpress-multisites-mirror\/issues\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/github.com\/kien\/wordpress-multisites-mirror\/issu",
