                "description": "<p>'Pages and Posts in Feed' is a simple plugin that modifies WordPress RSS feed to include both 'Page' and 'Post' types in the site's feed. This creates a site feed with both pages and blog posts in it. Useful for those who use WordPress as a CMS.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin needs no configuration. Just activate it, and you are good to go. Deactivating the plugin restores RSS feeds to their default state.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Plugin Page<\/h4>\n\n<p>SumTips (<a href=\"http:\/\/sumtips.com\/2011\/12\/include-page-custom-post-type-wordpress-feed.html\">http:\/\/sumtips.com\/wp-page-in-feed<\/a>)<\/p>",
