But, you have more people attending than things to give away.  Now you can use this plugin to hold a drawing for the free prize!<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin will connect to the Meetup.com API and select a random member of your Meetup who RSVPed to your event so you can give a prize at the event.<\/p>\n\n<p>To use, install the plugin, activate, and add your Meetup.com API key in the settings.  Next, add the shortcode [meetup_winner eventid=\"110963702\"] to any page on your site and replace the number with the Event ID of your Meetup Event.  Whenever you visit that page or refresh the page a new winner will be selected.<\/p>",
