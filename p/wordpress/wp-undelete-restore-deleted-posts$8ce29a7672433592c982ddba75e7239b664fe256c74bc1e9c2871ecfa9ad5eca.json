For now, it will allow you to restore only posts (custom post types\/pages support coming in next release!) and comments of deleted posts, as well as tags and category associations, are lost (again, this will be a feature of the next version!)<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm not the only person who's accidentally hit \"Delete Permanently\" or \"Empty Trash\" on posts - just recently a client of mine lost an entire day's work, some 80 items, after emptying the Trash without thinking. It got me thinking \"Man, I wish I could undelete stuff.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>WP Undelete is like a backup utility for stuff you delete. It operates in the background, without any input from you, and you won't even know it's there - until you need it.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's lightweight, simp",
