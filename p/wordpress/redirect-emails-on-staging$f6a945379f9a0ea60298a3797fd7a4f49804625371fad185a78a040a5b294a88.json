This plugin redirects all emails to the site admin.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin should be activated on your Production site. Don't worry &#8212; it won't do anything <em>unless<\/em> it is active on Staging site. Once you create a new copy of your Staging site, the plugin will start taking effect there.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is compatible with WordPress Multisite. If you're using it in a Multisite environment, it is recommended to either Network Activate the plugin, or follow the instructions for installing it to the <code>mu-plugins<\/code> directory.<\/p>",
