This plug-in creates a dashboard widget with clearly labeled large buttons of the most common tasks one would perform when using wordpress as a content management system.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have found that particularly when handing a Wordpress CMS over to less than tech-savvy clients, there is often confusion on how to perform some of the more simple tasks simply because the Wordpress side menu can be overwhelming. This plugin creates a simple to use dashboard interface that will let clients easily post, edit, manage users and change widgets with out having to do any hunting or searching.<\/p>",
