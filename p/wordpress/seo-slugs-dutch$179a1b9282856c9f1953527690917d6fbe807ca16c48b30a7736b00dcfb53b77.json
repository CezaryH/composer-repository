With SEO Slugs plugin activated, the slug for our example blog post would look like this:<\/p>\n\n<p>\/vijf-tips-hoger-google-scoren<\/p>\n\n<p>The slug is generated on saving a post (so you get a chance to look at it before publishing, and change it), or on publish. It won't overwrite an existing slug. You can force a new slug generation by deleting the existing one.<\/p>",
