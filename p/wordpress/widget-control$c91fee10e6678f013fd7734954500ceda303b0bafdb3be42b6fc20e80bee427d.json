At the moment the only feature \nit has is the ability to disable all Widgets at the same time. I hope to get some time and ideas to add more features\nin the future.&#60;br\/&#62;\n&#60;br\/&#62;\nI've only tested the plugin with WP 2.7.0 and 2.7.1, but it will probobly work in older version as well. Let me know!&#60;br\/&#62;\n&#60;br\/&#62;\n<a href=\"mailto:david.martensson@gmail.com?subject=Widget Control\">Contact me<\/a> for requests or bug reports! :)<\/p>",
