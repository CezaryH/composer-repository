It is only an addon to the Solilquy slider which is available in the WordPress Repo as a lite version or you can get the <a href=\"http:\/\/solilquywp.com\" title=\"Soliloquy - WordPress Slider\">affordable PRO version here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Scheduled Slides will add a begin and expiration date to each slide you add within Solilquy. This gives you the ability to add slides that you don't want to display just yet. It also lets you set an expiration date for those time sensitive slides. Set it and forget it!<\/p>",
