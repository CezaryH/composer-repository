If you've bought one plugin for your site this is probably overkill. If you're a developer you don't need this on your client's sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a simple plugin that removes the notice.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: If you do decide to you install the WPMU notifications plugin, please deactivate this one first. Errors may occur if you don't.<\/p>",
