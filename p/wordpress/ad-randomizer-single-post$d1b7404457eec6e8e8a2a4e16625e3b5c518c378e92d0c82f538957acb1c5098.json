                "description": "<p>This plugin allows you to insert adsense (or other ad programs) into your posts (pages optional) either at the top of the post, the top left, top right, middle left, middle right or bottom of the post, and it will randomly show whatever ad unit you have saved at the specified location. In other words you might see a 468 by 60 ad at the top of the page one minute and the next you might see a 350 by 200 image ad in the middle of the page floating left of the content, or you might see a 200 by 200 text ad floating right of the content at the top of the page. Just save the ad code you want to use in each available slot and the plugin will randomize the ad for you so you can play with different ad units and ad positions without having to do any work other than setting up the plugin upon activation.\nFor more information and support please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/wppluginsdev.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/wppluginsdev.com<\/a><\/p>",
