Logged in users will be able to view the website as they normally would.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin will automatically create a <code>maintenance.php<\/code> file and add it to your <code>\/wp-content\/<\/code> directory. Customize this page to change the appearance and text of the maintenance mode page.<\/p>\n\n<p>Known bugs\n* Right now, this plugin will not work on certain servers (like Antagonist.nl) because of a permissions issue.<\/p>",
