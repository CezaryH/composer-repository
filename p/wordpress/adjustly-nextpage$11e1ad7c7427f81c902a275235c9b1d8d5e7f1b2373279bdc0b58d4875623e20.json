                "description": "<p>Developed internally for our Adjustly theme, this plugin allows authors to create multi-page posts and pages to the WordPress Visual and HTML toolbar. This is not a post-to-post navigation feature, this is specifically about adding page breaks to a single, very long page\/post. We did not create any new features with this plugin, it simply brings back an existing feature to the toolbar.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Try the Demo<\/h4>\n\n<p>If you're interested in seeing what a default installation of Adjustly Nextpage has to offer, we have a verbose sample post located here.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.psdcovers.com\/adjustly-nextpage\/\">http:\/\/www.psdcovers.com\/adjustly-nextpage\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<h4>Usage<\/h4>\n\n<p>Usage is identical to adding the more separator and looks as follows:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&#060;!--nextpage--&#062;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>That's it.  Wordpress already has support for treating this as a page break when viewing the article and will add a page navigation tool at the end of each page or post. In fac",
