Using the CityGrid API you can pull places including their address, city, state, zip code and phone number. You can also pull a wealth of other content including photos, videos, reviews and offers.<\/p>\n\n<p>This Wordpress plug allows you deploy a local business search for any Wordpress blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>To use this module you will need to register for a CityGrid publisher account at <a href=\"http:\/\/developer.citygridmedia.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/developer.citygridmedia.com\/<\/a>. The system will work temporarily without a publisher code, but if you wish to take advantage of advertising or revenue sharing opportunities, and have it work reliably, you will need to have your own publisher code.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you have your publisher code you can enter it on the plugin settings page, the search mechanism will be associated with your account.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally you can also choose to display or not display CityGrid ads",
