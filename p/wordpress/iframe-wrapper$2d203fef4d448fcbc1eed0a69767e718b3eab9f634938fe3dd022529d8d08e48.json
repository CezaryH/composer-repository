But when you want to embed\none website inside of another one in a single step, they're a really easy way to make it work.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Usage<\/h4>\n\n<p>Inside whatever post or page you want to embed another site, use the short code<\/p>\n\n<p>[iframeWrapper url=http:\/\/example.com]<\/p>\n\n<p>This will put an iframe linking to example.com into your page. The width will\nbe 100% of the contain it's in and the height will automatically adjust to the\ncontents of the frame.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin was originally written to embed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.proofbuddy.com\">ProofBuddy<\/a>\nsites within a WordPress theme without much fuss. But it should work well to embed\nany site within a WordPress theme.<\/p>",
