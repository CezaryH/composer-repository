You can set a different excerpt length for each use of the widget. Or exclude an excerpt and show only title. Or exclude both title and excerpt and show only thumbnail. Show or hide author and date. Show additional post titles in a list underneath your main features. Style each widget differently by supplying individual before and after widget code and before and after title code or leave those sections blank to default to your current theme widget styles. You can really do a lot with it. There are other category posts widget plugins out there that are quite popular and have a great reputation. Thi",
