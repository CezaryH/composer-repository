                "description": "<p>Custom Single Post Templates Manager is a plugin that enables you to configure and manage up to 20 custom single post templates. It's for people who want posts from certain categories to have their own unique display. You have to design the template the way you want it to look of course. The plugin just allows you to manage your templates separately from your theme so that if you switch from one theme to another you won't need to write new filter functions for each new theme. You'll only need to setup the template files then tell the plugin where to find the files and which category should be filtered using which file.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information and support please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/wppluginsdev.com\/category\/custom-single-post-templates-manager\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/wppluginsdev.com\/category\/custom-single-post-templates-manager\/<\/a>.  Instructions for configuring custom templates can be found on the installation page (<a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/custom-single-post-t",
