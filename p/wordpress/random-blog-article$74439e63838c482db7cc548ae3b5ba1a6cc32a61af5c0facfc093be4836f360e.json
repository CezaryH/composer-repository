After this, every 15 seconds \n(by default) a new blog and article are randomly picked from your favourite blog list. The RSS feeds are cached so\nno need to worry about bandwidth usage or your blog being slowed down!<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin just needs to be activated and a small peice of code put in a template file for where ever you'd \nlike it to appear. All settings can be controled in the wordpress admin panel and there is no need to edit any code.<\/p>",
