It can scan the folder locations WordPress and display on the top left socket to switch on the fly localization of your blog. Your chosen location is stored in the cookie, and even if you return to this blog with the plugin installed Pti\u0092s WP-Multi-language plugin you will see it with the same interface as the chosen few weeks ago.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition, for the administrative part, you just can select the desired localization. This setting is saved in a different cookie, and does not depend on the localization settings that you chose for the site. This can be useful if multiple users to post on one blog from different countries and may have difficulty if they see the administrative part of them in an unknown language.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin is able to identify localization not only in terms of complete containment, such as ru_RU or fr_FR, it can also detect and display a flag of the country on linguistic lines. Premer good to be a plugin di",
