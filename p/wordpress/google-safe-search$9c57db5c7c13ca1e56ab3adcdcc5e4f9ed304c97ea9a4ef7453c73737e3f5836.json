It gives you the option to upload files to either the default location, or to a subdirectory named \"screen\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Separating uploads in this manner may be necessary because Google does not support the current ICRA standard for content rating.  Blogs containing a small number of images that are inappropriate for some audiences may have the entire domain blocked in Google's Image Search results unless those few images are separated from the others.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to Google employee Susan Moskwa, \"We filter at the site- or directory-level, not on individual images; so the best thing would be to put fully \"safe\" images in one folder, and \"moderate\" and\/or \"strict\" images in a different folder(s) ... If you had a particular folder that contained all the safe images (or all the unsafe images) we should be able to whitelist the clean stuff.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>For background information, s",
