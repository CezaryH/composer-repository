It handles what happens after we die.\nIt monitors your own visits to your wordpress system, and will send you a warning email after a number of\nweeks (of your choice) without a visit.\nIf you fail to visit your blog even after that, the system will send a mail you wrote to whoever you choose.<\/p>\n\n<p>All time intervals and messages are customizable.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is useful for those that want their blog to out-live them, and serve as an online memorial.\nEven without use of this plugin, all are recommended to make sure someone can handle their website in\ncase of emergency.<\/p>",
