                "description": "<p>This plugin creates a small photo album in the sidebar of your weblog and shows thumbnails of your photos using visual effects (javascript). The unique feature is a special shuffle mode and\/or loop mode, that ensures that the order of pictures in the photo album is different from page to page, but remains the same for a given page (even if this page is reloaded).<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore the order and picture selection changes for each page every day, so that over the time all photos from your collection will be displayed. As a bonus, there will be daily updates on pages that do show this sidebar widget. Your photo collection and the number of photos in the album is configurable in the admin section. Some OpenContent photos are included in the album and can be used for your experiments. Have a lot of fun ...<\/p>",
