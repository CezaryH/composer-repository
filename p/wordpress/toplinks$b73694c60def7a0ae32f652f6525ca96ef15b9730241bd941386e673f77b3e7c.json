Brought to you by Thornley Fallis and 76design.<\/p>\n\n<p>The toplinks plugin takes advantage of the sidebar widget feature available in Wordpress 2.2+ and above. \nIf you don't know what version you are running, login to your Wordpress admin and look at the bottom of the page, the version \nnumber is there. It should also be noted that your Wordpress theme must support sidebar widgets (if you are a theme developer \nand want to \"Widgetize\" your theme, check <a href=\"http:\/\/automattic.com\/code\/widgets\/themes\/)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/automattic.com\/code\/widgets\/themes\/)<\/a><\/p>",
