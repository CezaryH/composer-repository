Browser Specific CSS adds a short javascript to the head of your page that enables you to use browser specific css selectors. For example, targeting Internet Explorer 7 from your stylesheet is just a matter of defining styles with a \".ie7\" selector. Every major browser is supported including code for targeting Macs, PCs, and Linux operating systems.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin uses the javascript written by <a href=\"http:\/\/rafael.adm.br\/css_browser_selector\/\" title=\"Rafael Lima\">Rafael Lima<\/a>.
