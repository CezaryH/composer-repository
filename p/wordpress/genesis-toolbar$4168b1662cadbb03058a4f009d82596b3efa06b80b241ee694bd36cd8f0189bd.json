These buttons allow you to add tasks,\nprint letters, send emails, record phone logs, send text messages, add tags and categories, store relationships,\nattach files, change contact photos, access and record notes, remove contacts and a whole lot more! \n<br \/><br \/>\nEach button can be turned on or off from the admin area. If you do not need to print letters? Just turn that button off, \nit is that simple.The Toolbar was designed to be extended with other PlugIns as needed. To illustrate this we have written \nan [Edit Contact] PlugIn that adds a button to the Toolbar that allows you to edit the contacts basic information like their \naddress and phone numbers. We have also created another extension called [Extend Contact] that will let you add grouped \ncustom fields so you can record exactly the information you need. \n<br \/><br \/>\nThe Toolbar works directly within the page without reloading, making it easy to manage yo",
