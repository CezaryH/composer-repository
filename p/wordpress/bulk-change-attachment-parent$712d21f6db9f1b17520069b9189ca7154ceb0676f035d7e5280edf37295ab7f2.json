It adds a new option to the \"Bulk Actions\" dropdown on the media management page.<\/p>\n\n<p>The parent matters because the <code>[gallery]<\/code> feature simply lists out all uploads that have been attached to that post or page, so this will effectively allow you to move images between galleries.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lacquerhead.ca\/\">Joel Sholdice<\/a> deserves some credit for this plugin and I used his single-item changing plugin for inspiration.<\/p>",
