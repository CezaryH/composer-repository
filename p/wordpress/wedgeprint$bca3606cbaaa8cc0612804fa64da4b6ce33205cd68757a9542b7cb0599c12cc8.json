This plugin is in 'beta' phase at the moment, so 'handle with care', which translates into:\nbe careful in its use. It is recommended to try it first in a <em>pre-production environment<\/em> and closely inspect blog statistics for undesirable effects\nthe first days in production mode. The plugin controls through 'cookies' the number of messages a reader gets per hour: <strong>now variable!<\/strong>, so readers don't feel saturated ;)\nVisit our web page <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wedgeprint.net\" title=\"wedgeprint.net\">WedgePrint.net<\/a> and please follow our <strong>guidelines<\/strong> and <strong>warnings<\/strong>.\nYou are welcome to give us feedback about this project, feel free to take a look at the code.<\/p>",
