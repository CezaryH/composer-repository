By allowing content to be stored and edited in a single location on WordPress it is possible to update a single piece of content that will update retroactively anywhere that the reusable is being used. This plugin creates a more front-end approach to templatizing content and even makes it possible to create or modify an entire theme without touching the PHP code. You may also display entire pieces of content based on a users role thus adding another dimension of personalization to your site.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin also integrates with the <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/custom-content-types\">Custom Content Types<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/capsman\">Capability Manager<\/a> plugins.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>New in Version 3.0<\/em><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Reusable regions<\/strong> are widgets that admins can place into dynamic sidebars, reusables can then be assigned to regio",
