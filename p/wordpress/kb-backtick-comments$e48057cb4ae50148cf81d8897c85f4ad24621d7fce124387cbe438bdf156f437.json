It's very simple: To have code look right, all your commenters have to do is surround it in <code>backticks<\/code>, just like you can do in the Wordpress.org support forums.<\/p>\n\n<p>For demos, check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/adambrown.info\/b\/widgets\/2007\/11\/29\/announcing-kb-backtick-comments\/\">KB Backtick Comments demo<\/a> at my site.<\/p>\n\n<p>One important note. This plugin will always work in comments, but it will not work in posts unless you first disable the visual editor.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Support<\/h4>\n\n<p>If you post your support questions as comments below, I probably won't see them. If the notes in the plugin file don't answer your questions, then post your support questions on a post in the <a href=\"http:\/\/adambrown.info\/b\/widgets\/category\/kb-backtick-comments\/\">KB Backtick Comments category<\/a> at my site.<\/p>",
