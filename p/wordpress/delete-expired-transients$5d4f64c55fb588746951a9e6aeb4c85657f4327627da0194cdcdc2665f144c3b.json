In practise, because old transients are only deleted when requested again after they've expired, many transients stay in the database long after they've expired. After a while, there can be thousands or even millions of expired transients needlessly taking up space in your options table.<\/p>\n\n<p>Delete Expired Transients schedules a daily task to delete any expired transients from the options table. It performs this operation with a single SQL query, and then runs a second query to find any orphaned expiration records and deletes them too.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are a few other plugins around that clean up exp",
