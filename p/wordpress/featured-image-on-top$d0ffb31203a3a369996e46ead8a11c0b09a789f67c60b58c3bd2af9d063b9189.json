I use it almost first thing on every post I write, so I don't like searching for it.  This plugin will force that metabox on top for the \"post\" post type.\nThere's only one option available, in the regular <em>Media Settings<\/em> page.  \"Allow Users to Customize Order\" which is ON by default, can force users (if off) to have their \"Featured Image\" metabox stuck to the top.<\/p>\n\n<p>Feel free to contact me, <a href=\"mailto:emrikol@gmail.com\">emrikol@gmail.com<\/a>, if you have any problems or questions.<\/p>",
