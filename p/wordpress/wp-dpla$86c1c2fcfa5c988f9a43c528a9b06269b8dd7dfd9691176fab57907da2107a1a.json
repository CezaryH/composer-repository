It takes the tags you&#8217;ve assigned to your post &#8211; say, cheesehead and Packers or pizza, beer, and nachos &#8211; and fetches four random items from DPLA&#8217;s partner collections, and displays them at the bottom of the post.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin was originally developed for the Maker Challenge at <a href=\"http:\/\/chnm2013.thatcamp.org\/\">THATCamp CHNM 2013<\/a> (which it won!).
