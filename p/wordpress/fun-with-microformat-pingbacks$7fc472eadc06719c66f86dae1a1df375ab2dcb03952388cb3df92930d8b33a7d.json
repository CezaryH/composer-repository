What is a comment if not a review? Better yet the format already features a summary class that can be used to quick and simply summarise the points for readers of the original post.<\/p>\n\n<p>By Default WordPress will take a set number of characters from the source of a ping and present these as a comment. This is pretty useless for the most part. This plugin will parse the source of a ping looking for an hReview to see if better information can be gained about the opinion of the author.<\/p>\n\n<p>If that information is available the content of the comment will be replaced with the summary presented in the hReview.<\/p>\n\n<p>The following is an example of the HTML that you can use to do this if you are writing about another site.<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&#60;div class=\"hreview\"&#62;\n&#60;p class=\"item\"&#62;Bob over at Bob's Blog has written about &#60;a class=\"fn",
