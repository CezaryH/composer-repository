On the left side of the Slideshow it displays a Image for every Post. On the right side, there are all the Titles\n(and a small description under the Title) of the Posts\/Pages. The Slideshow highlights the active Post and repeats automatically after getting to the 5th Post.  You have a powerful Administration Area to adjust the\nwhole Layout of the Slideshow. Inserting new Posts\/Pages now is as easy as can be. Just choose \"Feature in WP-Content Slideshow\" when editing a post or a page.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Titles and small description<\/li>\n<li>Navigation possibility (when hitting a Title the Image appears)<\/li>\n<li>Image for every different Post (No need for timthumb anymore!)<\/li>\n<li>Support both posts and Pages now!<\/li>\n<li>Powerful Administration for Posts and Styles of the Slideshow<\/li>\n<li>Javascript Effects between different Posts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Future Plan<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Abilty to mak",
