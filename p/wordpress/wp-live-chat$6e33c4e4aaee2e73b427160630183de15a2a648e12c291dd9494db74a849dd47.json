Now Supports Freenode chat-rooms.<\/p>\n\n<p>The archive now contains TWO plugins, WP-Live-Chat-Adult, and WP-Live-Chat-Freenode. You may only activate ONE of these plugins at a time. Activating BOTH may cause conflicts in your wordpress. They use the same variables and function names.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin <em>WAS<\/em> distributed as <em>T-Shirt Ware<\/em> but no one seemed to like the idea that you actually got something BESIDES free software for your donation. Instead a single button sized advertisement was included in the CGI, and the donate link points to our Project Wonderful location to purchase Ad Space in the chat window, starting at One Cent ($.01) a day.<\/p>",
