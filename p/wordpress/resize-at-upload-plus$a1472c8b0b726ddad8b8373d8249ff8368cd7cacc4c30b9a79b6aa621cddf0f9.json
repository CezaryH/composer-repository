Huizinga.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin will automatically resize an image upon upload, depending on the maximum width and height that you define. Gone are the days when you, or your client, will ruin a site's layout by uploading a huge file with 25 megapixels.\nBe advised: there is no backup, no copy of the originally uploaded image.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin uses a class originally from Jacob Wyke (www.redvodkajelly.com).<\/p>",
