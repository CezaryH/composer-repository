Clicking any of these thumbnails will open a larger preview (in a cool lightbox format). Click the image if you want to license it and a new tab will open with the agency page.<\/p>\n\n<p>The 5 included agencies are:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Fotolia<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Dreamstime<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Shutterstock<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>123 Royalty Free<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Bigstock<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>With more coming in future.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is an expansion of a firefox microstock addon which has been live for almost 2 years, and has recently come to the chrome browser too in this new and more shiny format.
