It provides an options page under the Settings menu to change recruitment status for each class and spec. If all specs of a given class are up for recruitment, WOW Recruitment will simply list \"[Class] (All)\".<\/p>\n\n<p>In the sidebar widget, the name of each class is given the color that Blizzard uses in-game to denote the class. The title is an H2 tag and can be styled accordingly.<\/p>\n\n<p>WOW Recruitment can be localized. No localizations are distributed with the default version of the plugin, but users may feel free to write their own. Place localization files in the \/wp-content\/plugins\/wowrecruitment\/intl\/ directory.<\/p>\n\n<p>WOW Recruitment is provided as-is and no warranty is made as to its function or effectiveness. WOW Recruitment will not do your recruiting for you. It just provides the ad in your sidebar.<\/p>",
