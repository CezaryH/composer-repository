Just activate it and gallery images are automatically served from Photon.<\/p>\n\n<p>NextGEN Gallery's image size settings are respected, meaning you can update your gallery image sizes on the fly without regenerating images.<\/p>\n\n<p>Leveraging the WordPress.com's cloud, your galleries should load faster and use fewer hosting resources.<\/p>",
