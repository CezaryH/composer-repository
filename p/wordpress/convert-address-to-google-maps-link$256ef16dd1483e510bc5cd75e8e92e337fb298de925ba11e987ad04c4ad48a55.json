For example, you would need to write the following into your code: <code>&#60;address&#62;112 1\/2 Beacon Street, Boston 02108&#60;\/address&#62;<\/code><\/p>\n\n<p>FYI: This plugin is great for themes with custom fields that supply the address, but is probably not too useful for themes that don't.  Thanks!<\/p>\n\n<p>Finally, many many thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mikedoesweb.com\/\">Mike Jasper<\/a> , who wrote the javascript that powers this plugin.  I merely repackaged his code.<\/p>",
