                "description": "<p>A pretty common feature among content management systems is the ability to pull pieces of content onto a page which have been pre-defined within the database. However, with WordPress you are unable to do this on the page\/post level. Only in theme creation are you able to dynamically pull content from other files. This can be extremely useful for content that gets used throughout a site, as it can be very cumbersome trying to update something like a headline that is hard coded onto multiple pages. However, with this plugin you are able to create a reusable for these types of content and manage them in one place rather than editing each post\/page that the content is on.<\/p>",
