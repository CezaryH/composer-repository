The plugin comes with five default feeds (BBC news, WordPress and Harleyquine.com included) and the feeds are configurable from the settings page Settings &#62; Write About Me. The plugin has been tested in WordPress 2.7.1 but there\u0092s no reason why it wouldn\u0092t work in slightly older installations.<\/p>",
