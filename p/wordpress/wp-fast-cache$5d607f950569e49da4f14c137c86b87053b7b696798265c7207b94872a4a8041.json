This caching system allows users to cache, pages, posts, categories and any other url on their website.<\/p>\n\n<p>This cache works by creating a static html file for every page cached and then serving that page up first, meaning for cache pages apache only has to serve up static html files, no need to run any PHP or make any database calls.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Caching system has a simple to user interface for creating, managing and updating cached pages. It also hooks into pages\/posts for easy to user cache management on a page level.<\/p>\n\n<p>Features:\n- bulk caching of all pages, posts, categories\n- caching of all permalink types including \/?p=123 format\n- Easy to use cache management\n- Page\/Post level caching management<\/p>\n\n<p>Requirements:\n- Apache Mod Rewrite\n- Writable .htaccess (manual work around available)\n- Writable wp-content (manual work aroun",
