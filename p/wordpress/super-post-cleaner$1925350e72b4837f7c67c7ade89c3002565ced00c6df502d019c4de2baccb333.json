This is an improvement over other similar plugins that would constantly delete custom menus. This plugin works automatically in the background once it is enabled.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin will automatically delete posts with the exact same post title as a previous post, leaving the original post undisturbed. This is particularly useful for when you have syndicated content or auto-posts that result in erroneous duplicates. The original will remain, and all the duplicates will be deleted, allowing you to preserve your page views on the original.<\/p>",
