It lists the keywords as a sidebar widget so that users might click on them and find information using the WordPress built-in search. In this way a user might find more pages that satisfy his search and other users may be interested in the same things that previous searchers used as queries.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is important that you go into the keyword maintenance under settings to clean out the keyowrds with only one or two hits. This will reduce the amount of data in the database and possibly speed things up a small amount.<\/p>\n\n<p>One interesting thing is that seach engines see the search terms, which leads to more people hitting the pages based on the search terms from previous surfers. If one of the terms is a popular search, it leads to more searches. Very quickly the top 30 keywords are sending you traffic for things that may have appeared on the list accidentally at first. There is a positive feedback loop.<\/",
