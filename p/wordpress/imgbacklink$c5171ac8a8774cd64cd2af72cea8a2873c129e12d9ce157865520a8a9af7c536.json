This plugin makes it easy to use the LinkMyPics javascript by Michael VandeMar on your Wordpress site. Just install the plugin and all the images in your content section will be covered.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is different to the other available image backlink generators in that the code box only shows when someone right clicks your image for information  - so there are no code boxes showing that can spoil the look and flow of your page. It also covers all your images in a post rather than just the first one.<\/p>\n\n<p>The code that is shown to your web site visitor who wants to use your image is given in html - which includes the web address of the page, the source url of the image and the alt tags for the image. It also gives the bbcode for linking which includes the url of the post page and the image source url.<\/p>\n\n<p>There's no settings to worry about just uplo",
