                "description": "<p>The Just a Quote Widget allows you to easily configure a quote to appear in your blog's sidebar. Simply enter the title, quote, and source into the included input fields, and you're done. For ease of use, there is quote-like formatting already built into the widget; if you do, however, wish to style it yourself (via your theme's stylesheet), you're more than welcome. Simply select the \"Style the quote yourself?\" option, and the default formatting will be deactivated, allowing you to go CSS-crazy in your theme's stylesheet.<\/p>\n\n<p>For those CSS bandits styling the widget themselves, use the <strong>.just-a-quote<\/strong> (for the quote text) and <strong>.just-a-quote-source<\/strong> (for the source text) classes in your theme's stylesheet.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please submit any bug reports, support questions, or requests <a href=\"http:\/\/anthonybubel.com\/contact\">here<\/a>.<\/p>",
