Plogger will then be embedded in the page correctly, and will become part of your WordPress website rather than sitting outside it.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>NB: there are many better gallery plugins available for WordPress, and Plogger doesn't appear to be being maintained any more; I personally like <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/nextgen-gallery\/\">NextGEN Gallery<\/a>. Plogger can still be useful though, especially for those \"Trade\/Media\" areas that allow journalists to download lots of product images, but I now have a plugin that lets you do that with NextGEN Gallery: <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/nextgen-download-gallery\/\">NextGEN Download Gallery<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>",
