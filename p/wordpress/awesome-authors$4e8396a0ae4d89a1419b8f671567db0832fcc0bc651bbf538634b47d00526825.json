The author with the most recent post will be displayed first, the author with the second latest will be displayed second, and so on.<\/p>\n\n<p>Awesome Authors allows you to select 'Sticky Authors.' These authors will be displayed at the front of the list no matter how long ago their latest post was published. Conversely, you can select authors to be 'Excluded Authors.' These authors will never be displayed in the list no matter how many posts they have or how recently their last post was published. You can also set a minimum post requirement. If you set this to, let's say 10, then only authors with 10 or more published posts will be displayed on the Author Bar. Some of the other options include gravatar display size, and how many authors overall to display.<\/p>",
