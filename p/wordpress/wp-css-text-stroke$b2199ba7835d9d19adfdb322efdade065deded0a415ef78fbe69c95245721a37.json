For example text on Google Maps is displayed that way.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin contains a piece of javascript code that's called on window load and that enables you to get text stroking on any piece of text on your web page's template. The trick is to repeat the text element 9 times in white color in the background, each instance being slightly moved from the original text position.<\/p>\n\n<p>Detailed description is at <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.mapmyglobe.com\/css-text-stroke\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/blog.mapmyglobe.com\/css-text-stroke\/<\/a><\/p>",
