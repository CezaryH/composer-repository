Unlike regular posts and pages, attachment pages don't offer any UI controls that let you choose (on an individual basis) which attachment pages should allow comments and pings.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin corrects this issue by giving you the ability to turn comments and pings on or off for individual attachment pages within your media library.<\/p>\n\n<p>The global setting to allow comments or pings by default already applies to attachment pages.<\/p>",
