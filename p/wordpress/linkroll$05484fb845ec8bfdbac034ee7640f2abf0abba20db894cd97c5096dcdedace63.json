Just install the plugin and go to your widget screen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Linkroll also comes with a short-code that you can use to put links directly into your posts. [linkroll post=\"My Blog Post\"] will put a link to the post called \"Post Title\" (requires that the post name be unique).<\/p>\n\n<p>Linkroll is under active development, as of June 2013. It keeps getting better! The best links plugin in WordPress.<\/p>",
