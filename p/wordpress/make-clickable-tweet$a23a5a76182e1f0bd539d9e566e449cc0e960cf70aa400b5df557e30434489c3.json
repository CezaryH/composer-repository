                "description": "<p>In a recent project, I had a bunch of tweet content saved and needed a way to convert all URLs, hashtags, and user mentions into clickable links. I found that WordPress has a built-in function called <a href=\"http:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Function_Reference\/make_clickable\">make_clickable()<\/a>, but it just works with plain URLs, so I took it one more step to make_clickable_tweet(). It's basically a regular expression wrapped in a simple function, but I figured someone else out there might need it.<\/p>",
