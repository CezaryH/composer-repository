If you write plugins I'm sure you are always being asked for recommendations.\nThis simple plugin allows you to show off the plugins you have favorited on your WordPress.org plugin author profile in a sidebar widget.<\/p>\n\n<p>Your users and site visitors will know what plugins you like.  You can also display the plugins star rating along with the author with link to the author uri.<\/p>\n\n<p>The styling is minimal and easily adapts to your theme design with few hooks added for extension if needed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now includes option to shuffle results.  Only want to show 4 of your favorites but you have more?  Just choose the shuffle option and the results will be randomized on each page load (Does not decrease performance).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How does it work?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Just in time for WordPress 3.5 a new addition was made to the WordPress.org plugins api.  The api allows you to fetch your favorites",
