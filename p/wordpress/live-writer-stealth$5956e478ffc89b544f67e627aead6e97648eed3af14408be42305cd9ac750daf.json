I don't see this post on my live site!  What is it??<\/p>\n\n<p>If you're a user of Windows Live Writer (which, by the way is an EXCELLENT wysiwyg for blogging), then the answer is right\nin front of you.<\/p>\n\n<p>Windows Live Writer, in order to give the best quality possible, needs to detect the theme information for your blog.  The\nway it does this is to create a temporary blog post, read it really quick, then delete it again right away.  The problem is,\nsometimes the posts don't get deleted.  Worse yet, they may be picked up by RSS readers or indexed by an external source\n(feedburner, anyone?) before it manages to be deleted.<\/p>\n\n<p>So while it needs to be done, it can also be a pain in the backside.<\/p>\n\n<p>Live Writer Steal",
