                "description": "<p>Distinct from simply a mobile version of your web site, the goal of The App Maker is to be able to make something that looks and feels like a native app.  It's not meant to display your entire content, but rather to display specific posts, pages or custom post types in an easy to use, cross-device mobile format.  Further, it is the goal of The App Maker to be able to deliver the content such that it can be saved to the user's device for later offline use.<\/p>\n\n<p>The App Maker uses <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sencha.com\/products\/touch\/\">Sencha Touch<\/a> as the Javascript framework for building the app.  The App Maker adds an App custom post type allowing you to build as many apps as you want.  The apps themselves are rendered using shortcodes.  For a Sample App, please see the Frequently Asked Questions section.<\/p>",
