                "description": "<p><strong>WordPress Hovercards<\/strong> is a open source WordPress plugin that instantly integrates hovercards inside of your WordPress blog without any configuration. It only weighs <strong>4 KB!<\/strong> which is incredibly lightweight!<\/p>\n\n<p>Hovercards have been used for many years by Facebook, Twitter and plenty of other websites as a mean of engagement. It helps encourage people to view other pages on your site, and it is an excellent way to boost the clickthroughs and page views of your blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hovercards will provide a JSON endpoint to your WordPress blog to make Hovercard-related data available to use through the frontend. Then we use our JavaScript plugin to call the same endpoint, and if it finds data, it displays a gorgeous hovercard as you see above!<\/p>\n\n<p>It's intelligent enough to detect which links don't need a request, and it caches in-browser within all browsers. This saves HTTP requests to your server which aren't needed and therefore being efficient!<\/p>",
