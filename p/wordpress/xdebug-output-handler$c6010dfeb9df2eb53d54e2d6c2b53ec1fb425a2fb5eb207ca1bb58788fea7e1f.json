It both works in the front end and in the administrator interface of WordPress<\/p>\n\n<p>Please make sure that you comply to the following dependencies:\n*   have the Xdebug extension for PHP activated (zend_extension=\/[path to libraries]\/xdebug.so)\n*   have defined your 'WP_DEBUG' as true (in wp_config.php) to see also Notices<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin does nothing with the profiler output of Xdebug. When Xdebug is enabled on your webserver, outputted errors will be expanded with a Call Stack which shows which calls led to the error. This plugin takes care of displaying these errors in a nice way.<\/p>",
