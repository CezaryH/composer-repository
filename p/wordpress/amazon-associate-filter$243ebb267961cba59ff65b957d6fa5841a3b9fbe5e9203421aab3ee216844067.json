ALWAYS check that your Amazon Associate ID is correct after activating or updating this plugin. \nIf you do not have an Amazon Associates ID, you can get one here: <a href=\"http:\/\/affiliate-program.amazon.com\/gp\/associates\/join\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/affiliate-program.amazon.com\/gp\/associates\/join<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin has not been tested with international Amazon URLs, but has been updated to preserve international TLDs.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you experience any bugs, <a href=\"http:\/\/agaskar.com\/post\/106141451\/wordpress-amazon-associat",
