On top of that, the actual count algorithm was flawed. Rather than hack\nthis plugin to pieces to get the output I needed, I decided to just roll my own.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a bare bones, no-frills plugin since this is my first attempt at it. This means no\nfancy options or configuration screens.<\/p>\n\n<p>To use the plugin, simply install it and then use the following shortcode to output the number\nof days until a given date in its place:<\/p>\n\n<p>[days_until date=\"SPECIFIC DATE\"]<\/p>\n\n<p>Where \"SPECIFIC DATE\" can be any text that that PHP's strtotime function can understand.<\/p>",
