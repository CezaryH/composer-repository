                "description": "<p>The Daily Chess Puzzle Widget is a convenient way to add a puzzle to the sidebar of your blog. Each day a new puzzle is posted with three difficulty levels as well as a hint option. The puzzle is updated daily by the good folks at shredderchess.com. From the widget menu you have the ability to select the size of board you would like to show.<\/p>\n\n<p>This widget wouldn't be possible without the help of php guru Aaron Brown. Thanks, Aaron!<\/p>\n\n<p>Changelog:<\/p>\n\n<p>Version 0.1<br \/>\n- The first version of this plugin adds the ability to select the size of chess puzzle that gets displayed in your sidebar as well as the ability to display a custom title.<\/p>",
