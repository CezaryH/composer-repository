When a list is created, you edit the blog posts and assign them to the list. When a blog post is assigned to a list, they can be listed in your blog posts.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin differs from the other ones out there, because it does no magic! (And that&#8217;s a good thing). You have to create a list. Assign various blog posts to that list.<\/p>\n\n<p>You have complete control of your related posts, making this plugin a great asset when you create a series of blog posts, with different parts or chapters.<\/p>",
