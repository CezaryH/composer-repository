Plus the script is compatible in every major browser, even IE6.<br \/>\nFor a installation guide checkout the <strong>Installation<\/strong> tab above.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Usage Guide:<\/strong> It's very easy to implement. Just use a rel=\"prettyPhoto\" attribute with the link tags you want to pop up and that's all. You're ready to rock.<\/p>\n\n<p>Example: <code>&#60;a href=\"images.jpg\" rel=\"prettyPhoto\" title=\"This is the description\"&#62;&#60;img src=\"thumbnail.jpg\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" alt=\"This is the title\" \/&#62;&#60;\/a&#62;<\/code><br \/>\nA set of short codes to use with visual editor of post\/page is being cooked.<\/p>\n\n<p>Make sure that your theme is WordPress header and footer tag enabled otherwise thi",
