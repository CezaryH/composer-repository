Do you ever spend time to check whether all your old links which you purchased are still there or not.There are very high chances that the other webmaster may have dropped your link after collecting the payments. It is also a very time consuming process to check back links daily and practically impossible.Well what if your wordpress could maintain a list of back links to your site and check them daily. iRedlof Link Scanner plugin is what it is build for.<\/p>",
