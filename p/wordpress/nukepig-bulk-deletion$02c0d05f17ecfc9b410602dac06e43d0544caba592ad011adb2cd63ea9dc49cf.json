One wrong column header in the CSV you import with ImportPiG or a small typo in your seed keyword used by ContentPiG and suddenly your blog has thousands of incorrect posts and maybe even tens of thousands of tags if you're using TagPiG. Deleting these with the native WordPress interface is a real bind as it only allows you to display 20 items per page, even with the new bulk delete feature of 2.5 you can only delete what you can see listed so it still requires thousands of clicks to empty your pre-populated blog.<\/p",
