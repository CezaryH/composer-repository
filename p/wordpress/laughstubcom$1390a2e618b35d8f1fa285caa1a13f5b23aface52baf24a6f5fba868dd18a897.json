Maintain your schedule centrally and watch all your website have an up-do-date calendar of upcoming shows without doing any work at all.<\/p>\n\n<p>LaughStub.com is much more than just a web application with some servers behind it and a few thousands lines of code... it's a comedy engine. It's a platform allowing for comedy clubs to join the online world in a new way. This engine allows for venues, be it small or large, to sell their tickets, track their customers via an advanced CRM, share their shows on all the popular social networking platforms, manage their sales, manage their marketing &#38; emails, and most importantly cater to their customers based on their online choices.<\/p>\n\n<p>Why did we develop LaughStub.com? Because we believe that not only does comedy need a technology upgrade, but also because we love live comedy. Stay put, a lot more to come, and I'm sur",
