You can give the widget any number of feeds, and limit the quantity of images to be displayed.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can use any kind of RSS feed, but they must contain thumbnails (the plugin will check for, in that order, media:thumbnail tags, or enclosure tags, or, if none of these are found, an img tag inside the feed item description). If you don't undestand a word of this, just make sure your feed carries thumbnails, otherwise all you'll see is a \"No thumbnail found\" text...<\/p>\n\n<p>You can also use this plugin from your theme templates, to display images lists anywhere else on your blog and you can easily give them a fixed size or a maximum size with CSS styling.<\/p>",
