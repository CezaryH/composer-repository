But apparently other developers don't, and you end up with PHP error output\ngenerated by these other plugins.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin will make your life a bit easier. Leave WP_DEBUG set to true like you should. Then if you need to do\nsome testing with a different theme or plugin that is generateing PHP errors, you can disable that output\nwith a simple click in this plugin instead of having to edit your wp-config.php file.<\/p>",
