Powered by the [http:\/\/openweathermap.org\/API](OpenWeatherMap API).<\/p>\n\n<p>The design has been deliberately kept simple. It should match the default text of any theme, but can easily be customized by any web developer.<\/p>\n\n<p>It was built and tested on 3.5.x, but will probably work on earlier versions of WordPress.<\/p>",
