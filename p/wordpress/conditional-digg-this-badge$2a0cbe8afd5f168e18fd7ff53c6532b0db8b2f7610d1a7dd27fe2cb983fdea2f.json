This way you can automatically add badges to your articles without having a bunch of \"1 Digg\" articles.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plug-in inserts some Javascript into your articles.  This Javascript allows the plug-in to access the Digg API.  Through the API, the plug-in determines if your article has enough Diggs (by default: 10).  If it does, the \"Digg This\" badge is displayed.  Otherwise, the Javascript is deleted and no badge is shown.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note on Wordpress version:  This should work on earlier versions.  However, it's only been tested on Versions 2.3.3 and up.  If you successfully use the plug-in on an earlier version of Wordpress, please leave a comment at the plugin homepage so that I can update the information in this readme.<\/p>",
