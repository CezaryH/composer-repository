The biggest difference between Super Secret and other membership plugins is that the membership plugin redirects you to the WordPres login page, Super Secret does not. Super Secret will return a proper 404 HTTP Header, telling browsers that the website is not found. It will also display a \"Not Found\" generic dummy page.<\/p>\n\n<p>This doesn't mean your website is 100% hidden from everyone who attends it. Users can still see <code>wp-login.php<\/code><\/p>\n\n<p>When you publish a post, WordPress notifies other blogs linked to from your post. This could give away the presense of your blog!  Make sure you disable all of these!<\/p>\n\n<p>Inside \"Settings &#62; Discussion Settings &#62; Default article settings\":<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Disable <em>\"Attempt to notify any blogs linked to from the article.\"<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Disable <em>\"Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks.)\"<\/em>\"<\/li>\n<\/u",
