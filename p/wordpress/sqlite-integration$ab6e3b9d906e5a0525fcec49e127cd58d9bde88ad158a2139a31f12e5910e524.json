SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, transactional SQL database engine. It is not a full-featured database system like MySQL or PostgreSQL, but it best fits for low to medium traffic websites.<\/p>\n\n<p>SQLite Integration is a kind of wrapper program, which is placed between WordPress and SQLite database and works as a mediator. It works as follows:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Intercepts the SQL statement for MySQL from WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Rewrites it for SQLite to execute<\/li>\n<li>Give it to SQLite<\/li>\n<li>Gets the results from SQLite<\/li>\n<li>Formats the results as WordPress wants, if necessary<\/li>\n<li>Give the results back to WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>WordPress thinks she talks with MySQL and doesn't know what has happened in the background. She really talks with SQLite and will be happy with it.<\/p>\n\n<p>SQLite Integration is a successo",
