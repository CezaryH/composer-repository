Works only in conjunction with\nUser Access Manager and requires PHP 5.3.<\/p>\n\n<p>It was developed only as helper tool for another plugin which I am going to create in near future and\nI guess it can be helpful if you are interested how User Access Manager works. Plugin code is (or tries to be)\nwell documented.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin will probably not be updated any further. I provide no guarantees whatsoever.<\/p>",
