It then checks the WordPress.org plugin API twice a day for updated information about your plugin, including basic statistics and support thread information, and attaches that as post meta to the newly created custom post.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a developer oriented plugin, and should only really come in handy if you want your plugins from the official .org repo stored in a custom post type.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that you will probably need to account for a bunch of this post meta in your front end templates, otherwise the only real info you'll get is in the admin area.<\/p>",
