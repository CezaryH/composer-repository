If they are trying to reach other pages they will automatically be redirected to the public page.<\/p>\n\n<p>If a visitor is logged in, he can view all the pages\/posts on the blog (just like if it were a normal Wordpress installation).<\/p>\n\n<p>The public page can for example be used to display information about the site and a guide to how visitors can get an account.<\/p>\n\n<p>IMPORTANT: Wordpress still publish RSS feeds, so posts can still be read that way. Pages should be save though.<\/p>",
