You simply upload a php file containing your code into your theme folder and use a WordPress shortcode to \"include\" that file into your posts \/ pages \/ widgets.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin uses a filter to add shortcode capability for widgets in case that functionality isn't already present. If it is, then it is redundant, and I'm sorry ;)<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/magiksinc.com\/\" title=\"MaGiKS is where the magic happens\">MaGiKS Inc.<\/a><\/p>",
