The only problem is that sometimes it takes a bit of implementing to set these rules up. This implementation can either be setting a dataLayer variable in the dataLayer before the tag manager script is loaded, or pushing a HTML event handler with the variable \"event\" to the dataLayer when a button is clicked.
