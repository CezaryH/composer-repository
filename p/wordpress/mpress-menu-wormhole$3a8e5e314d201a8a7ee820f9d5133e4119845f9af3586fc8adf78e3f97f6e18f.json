Now let's say you want those same items to appear in a submenu off of your main header navigation.  Now you have to manage the same collection of pages in two places.  The mPress Menu Wormhole plugin makes it easy to maintain a single menu and have the changes you make to the sidebar menu automatically take place in the header menu as well.<\/p>\n\n<h4>How?<\/h4>\n\n<p>Using this plugin is simple:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Install the plugin.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin.<\/li>\n<li>Go to 'Appearance' -&#62; 'Menus' in the WordPress admin menu.<\/li>\n<li>You should see a box in the left column called 'Navigation Menus'.  If you don't see it, check the FAQ page for what you need to do.<\/li>\n<li>Check box next to the menu you want to add and click the 'Add to Menu' button",
