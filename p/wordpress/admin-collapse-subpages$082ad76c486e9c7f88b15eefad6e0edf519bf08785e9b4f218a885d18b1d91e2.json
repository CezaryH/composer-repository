                "description": "<p>Simple plugin that allows you to collapse subpages in the Pages admin list. Especially helpful if you have a ton of pages. It uses a cookie to save the expand\/collapse status of your pages.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is loosely based on Collapse Sub-Pages by Dan Dietz (<a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/collapse-sub-pages\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/collapse-sub-pages\/<\/a>), which broke with the 3.0 upgrade due to UI changes and hasn't been updated. I've had to rewrite the jQuery to make it work with 3.x versions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because this is a jQuery, it's possible that they could make additional changes that would break it. I'll do my best to stay on top of it, but let me know if it stops working.<\/p>",
