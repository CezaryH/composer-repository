When JuLiA parses a comment and decides that it is abusive, it will be removed from your \"Pending\" category and placed into the \"Abusive\" category. In addition, when JuLiA decides that a comment is definitely clean then it will simply be auto-published and save you time by skipping the \"Pending\" category entirely.<\/p>\n\n<p>JuLiA makes these decisions based not on keywords, but on the overall semantics present in a single comment.
