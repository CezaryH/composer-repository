                "description": "<p>Category Post Info Control is a simple plugin that enables you to hide the byline (the line below the title heading where the author and date of the post is displayed) on posts within certain \ncategories while still showing the byline in other categories. For example, if you have a portfolio page or product pages, something that's meant to look professional, you probably don't want \nto show the usual \"posted by HusbandHunterDad on 05\/10\/2012\". But you do want to show that information on blog pages on the same site. With this plugin you can put the portfolio or product posts into \none or more categories and mark those categories so that the byline is not displayed for them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Plugin homepage <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pspsoftware.co.za\/catpic-category-post-info-control\/\" title=\"PSP Software\">Hide WordPress byline<\/a><\/p>",
