It allows you to keep the updates separate from your blog content, and your Twitter timeline un-cluttered.<\/p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s dead simple to use, and we&#8217;ve made it highly configurable. It even has automagical real-time refresh. You post an update, and people following the event on your blog see the update refresh automatically. We&#8217;ve even built in support for short codes with configuration settings, so that you can place the widget on a WordPress page if you prefer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a listing of the awesome features that we&#8217;ve built in to WP Live Stream:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter Notification &#8211; Connect your Twitter account to WP Live Stream and send a tweet out with a link to your live stream when you start live blogging.<\/li>\n<li>Clear &#38; Archive &#8211; Clear your database of previous tweets or archive them.<\/li>\n<li>Widgetized - Place yo",
