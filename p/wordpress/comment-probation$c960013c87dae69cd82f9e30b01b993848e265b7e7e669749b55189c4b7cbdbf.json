It lets you approve a comment but place the author\nunder probation, meaning that any future comments from that author will need to be moderated again.<\/p>\n\n<p>When approving a comment, you're given the option to \"Approve\" the comment, or \"Approve with Probation.\"\nIf a comment ended up in moderation because the author is on probation, \"approving\" the comment will\nremove the author from the probation list.<\/p>",
