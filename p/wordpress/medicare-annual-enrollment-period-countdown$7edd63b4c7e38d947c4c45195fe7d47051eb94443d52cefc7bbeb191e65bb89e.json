Implemented as a shortcode [apcountdown] that you can put in any page, post, or text widget in your WordPress website.<\/p>\n\n<p>Throughout the year, Medicare maintains several enrollment schedules, including the Annual Enrollment Period, or AEP. AEP is a specific period of time when existing Medicare beneficiaries can make certain changes to their Medicare plans. Once AEP closes, no changes can be made until the following year unless you qualify for an exception (for example, because you move out of your service area). While in the past the dates have been different (November 15 \u0096 December 31), this year AEP is October 15 \u0096 December 7, 2011. Changes made to Medicare plans during this period become effective January 1, 2013.<\/p>",
