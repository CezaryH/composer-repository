                "description": "<p>Plastic Tunes is a \"now-playing\" plugin that allows your blog to display informations about the music you play in your media player, and most importantly, to insert them into your database. Artists, titles, albums and pretty much any information included in your digital music files goes into your database for real-time or later use, ready to be displayed on your sidebar, on a dedicated page or wherever you want. \nThe concept of this plugin, and quite a few lines of code were originally taken from version 0.1 of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thesmithsplace.com\/mutunes\">muTunes<\/a> plugin, made by Ken Smith -- although Plastic Tunes grew a lot since then.<\/p>",
