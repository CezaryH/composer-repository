                "description": "<p>'Only Pages in Feed' is a little plugin that modifies WordPress RSS feed to exclude all 'Post' types and show only 'Pages' in it. So if you are using WordPress as a CMS and want only Pages to appear in your site feed, this plugin is for you.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin needs no configuration. Just activate it, and you are good to go. Deactivating the plugin restores RSS feeds to their default state.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Plugin Page<\/h4>\n\n<p>SumTips (<a href=\"http:\/\/sumtips.com\/2011\/12\/include-page-custom-post-type-wordpress-feed.html\">http:\/\/sumtips.com\/wp-page-in-feed<\/a>)<\/p>",
