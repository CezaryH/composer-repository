I found that, this could only be done by modifying the \/includes\/general-template.php, which is not a good idea as this change had to be done everytime there was an update for wordpress.<\/p>\n\n<p>Therefore I came up with the idea of creating a plugin for the widget - \"search\".<\/p>\n\n<p>This widget lets the admin to modify the title of the search form and the text on the button.<\/p>\n\n<p>This widget can therefore be used instead of the \"search\" widget that comes with wordpress itself.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a drawback - this plugin does not change the form - title or button text of the search form that appears on the search page.<\/p>",
