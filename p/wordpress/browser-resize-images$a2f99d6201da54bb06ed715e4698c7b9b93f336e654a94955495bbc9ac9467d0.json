Just drag and drop big images and don't worry about your bandwidth or server space usage.<\/p>\n\n<p>Everything is configured in \"Settings\" &#62; \"Media\".<\/p>\n\n<p>It is using power of modern browsers to do the job - Chrome and Firefox would use HTML5 method and other browsers - Flash.\nGenerally it looks like Chrome is the best for the job (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.plupload.com\/\" title=\"plupload.com\">plupload.com<\/a>)<\/p>",
