The service which is used is freetellafriend.com which supports e-mail address book, social bookmarks and favorites.<\/p>\n\n<p>Abit about freetellafriend.com:<\/p>\n\n<p>FreeTellaFriend is a free service to allow your visitors to share your website with their friends. The idea is simple; you place a 'tell a friend' button on your website, and when your visitor decides to tell their friend about your website, they click this button which then presents them with a straightforward form to e-mail their friends.<\/p>\n\n<p>The great addition to FreeTellaFriend is your visitor can enter their e-mail username and password (we support major e-mail providers) and our system will automatically retrieve their contact list. Thereafter they can choose who to e-mail the website to. If one user decides to e-mail all their contacts, your website will be exposed to over 50 friends (on average).<\/p>\n\n<p>The following is supported: Tell a Friend, Social Bookmar",
