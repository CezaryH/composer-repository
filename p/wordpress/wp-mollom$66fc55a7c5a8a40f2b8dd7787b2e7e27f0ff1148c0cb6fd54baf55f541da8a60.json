                "description": "<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mollom.com\">Mollom<\/a> protects your website against comment and trackback spam. Mollom differs from other spam deterring services because it takes care of everything. The idea is to relieve you, the administrator, editor, maintainer,... of any moderation or clean up tasks you would normally need to perform in order to keep your blog spamfree.<\/p>\n\n<p>Mollom combines the power of intelligent text analysis to automatically filter spam with the efficiency of a safe\nCAPTCHA test. If Mollom is unsure if a comment is spam or not, it will present the visitor with a CAPTCHA test.\nUnless the test was completed succesfully, the comment will never be stored on your blog. Fallback on an automated\nCAPTCHA test allows Mollom to block up to 99,7% of all spam messages.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Important note for developers<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>WP Mollom 2 is currently under development on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/netsensei\/WP-mollom\">Github<\/a>.
