This happens because the first post is cached, and most people have no clue how to solve it. The manual solution it is not even evident... it is done via Facebook's developer-focused debugger -- <a href=\"http:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/tools\/debug\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/tools\/debug<\/a>. But just download our new Automatic Facebook Cache Cleaner plugin, and this will be handled for you automatically everytime!<\/p>",
