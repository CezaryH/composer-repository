The websites can share content if you wish it, and can have different titles, descriptions and themes. This plugin is a true plugin: there are NO HACKS and NO THEME EDITS of any kind. The plugin works with any other plugins and themes that use Wordpress&#8217; built in APIs, and features modular functions that can even make other plugins that use custom queries work also. However, this plugin is not for the novice user.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>This plugin is Officially unsupported. It is only a proof-of-concept.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Use at your own risk.<\/em><\/p>",
