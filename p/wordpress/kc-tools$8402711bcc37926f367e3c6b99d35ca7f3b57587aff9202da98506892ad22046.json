It allows reading of environment info, direct database access and terminal-like interface with server. It is locked by password to your browser only, so you can use it on life sites securely. It do nothing else - no output on pages, no shortcodes, no widgets, nothing, only a new row in \"Settings\" in Admin area.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nSometimes, when develop something new or try to find problem somewhere, needs to read \"raw\" info. Thus, this plugin is the right tool. But it is too powerfull tool, so it is not for everyone.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Blogers, self-webmasters, average users<\/strong>: This is not right tools for you. <a href=\"http:\/\/krumch.com\/contacts.html\">Contact me<\/a>, I can create anything what you will need, but leave this plugin away. It can (and will) destroy your site within seconds. No joke...<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Developers<\/strong>: Generally not for you too, but if you are br",
