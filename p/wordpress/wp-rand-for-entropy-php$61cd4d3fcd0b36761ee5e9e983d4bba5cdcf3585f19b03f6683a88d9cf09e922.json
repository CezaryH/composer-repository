                "description": "<p>On some 32bit hosts, the Entropy builds of PHP truncate integers larger than PHP_INT_MAX to PHP_INT_MAX rather than overflowing them as floats.<\/p>\n\n<p>This can cause <code>wp_rand()<\/code> to return a value outside the requested range.  That unexpected value in turn breaks <code>wp_generate_password()<\/code>, which can have security ramifications.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of particular note to this plugin's authors, the bug prevents <a href=\"http:\/\/jetpack.me\">Jetpack<\/a> from functioning.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin works around the bug by redefining the pluggable <code>wp_rand()<\/code> function.  In the redefinition, large integers are expressed as strings and cast to floats, rather than as ints.<\/p>",
