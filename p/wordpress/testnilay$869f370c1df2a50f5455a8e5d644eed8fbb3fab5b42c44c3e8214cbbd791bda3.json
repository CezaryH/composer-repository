But if you use an older version, you can at least use version 3.4 of this plugin.\nCAUTION! If you use the automatic plugin update of wordpress when migrating from version 4.0 to a newer one, you have to activate manually as directory structure changed. Delete the folder \"testnilay\" in your plugins folder afterwards, only \"embedded-video-with-link\" is still valid!<\/p>\n\n<p>Please rate this plugin! Please donate!<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin is made for easily embedding videos into a blog post. The videos can be integrated from external portals (like YouTube, Google Video and many many others) or they can be uploaded to the web server or a remote server and integrated as well. Additionally a corresponding link to the video on the particular video portal page or a download link to the local file can be generated automatically, if demanded. The linktext is also configurable individually.\nFurthermo",
