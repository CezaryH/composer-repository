This plugin may seem redundant when compared to \"posts\", seeing \nas how it has almost all the features of a post, but I'm attempting to separate the \"concept\" of publishing \"content\" as a journal entry i.e. post\nversus a periodical i.e. article, hope others find it useful.<\/p>\n\n<p>Widget supports the following:\n(Requirments: your theme must support Widgets! For this feature to work)\n* Custom title\n* Article count\n* Choose category to display (choosing ALL may result in \"post bleed\" on archive pages, not recommmended)\n* Choose tag to display\n* Choose thumbnail to display \n* Show posted on\n* Show posted in\n* Show excerpt (based on you",
