                "description": "<p>The Digg Protector will protect your blog from suffering from the Digg effect. When writing a post, give the HTML image tags a \"protect\" attribute to protect them. This means that when visitors from Digg come, they will be shown the image in the \"protect\" attribute. Otherwise, if they are not from Digg, they will be shown the image given in the \"src\" attribute. A basic HTML knowledge is recommended to use this plugin.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is intended that this be used to reduce server load if a page on your site is Digged. It is intended that you give a locally-hosted image in the \"src\" attribute, and a remotely-hosted image in the \"protect\" attribute, so the Diggers won't be loading all the images from your server.<\/p>",
