You can make multiple edits over any timeframe, all done &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; without disruptive or unreviewed changes to the live content. This enables a publishing workflow for edits to content that need to be reviewed and approved before being re-published. Once ready, publishing your version will replace the original post.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin was written by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bu.edu\/tech\">Boston University IS&#38;T<\/a> staff with design and UX support from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bu.edu\/id\">Interactive Design<\/a> group in Marketing &#38; Communications.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An alternate version can be cr",
