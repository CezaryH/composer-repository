This enables you to list all the books of a particular type (e.g. all books written by a particular author or with a specific rating). With very little effort, the book review system will be up and running on your site right away, with built in filters to add this extra information to the page without any custom theming.<\/p>\n\n<p>A configurable shortcode is also built in, to display a book list. <code>[book-reviews]<\/code> will display all books, while <code>[book-reviews count=3]<\/code> will only display 3 books and <code>[book-reviews count=3 covers=true]<\/code> will display those reviews with their covers, if they exist.<\/p>\n\n<p>Two sidebar widgets have also been included. A Recent Reviews widget will display the most recent book reviews that have been added, and a Related Books widget will displa",
