The plugin takes care of the obfuscation, implementing a graceful degradation technique focusing on usability so as to protect your email addresses from harvesters while keeping them usable to your human visitors.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin replaces any email address found in posts, pages, comments and excerpts, and replace them by a bit of html markup that should deceive most email harvesters: <code>&#60;span class=\"email\"&#62;john(replace the parenthesis by @)doe.com&#60;\/span&#62;<\/code>. \nIf javascript is available, it will display a clickable link and display the original email to the human user. Maximum usability, maximum protection.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/pixelines-email-protector\/\">rate the ",
