It implements a popular application design pattern called \nmodel-view-controller (MVC). In this case, Wordpress becomes the 'view' instead of a CI application.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin will probably work with versions of Wordpress earlier than 3.2, but if you are running such an earlier \nversion check your version of PHP. CodeIgniter requires PHP 5.1.6 or later.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: This is the first version of this plugin and it has not had extensive testing. Consider it experimental and use at \nyour own r",
