It will generate the title for you. Or you can select a statement from your post content to be a title for the post using shortcodes [agt][\/agt].<\/p>\n\n<p>How does it work?\nIf you leave the title field empty, only then this plugin will work.\nThere are two different ways, this plugin works: - \n* Firstly it will search the content to check whether you have used [agt][\/agt]shortcode or not. If used, it will make the wrapped line as title.\n* If you haven't used shortcode in your post, it will automatically pick first 30 characters from the post and will use them as post title.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently this plugin is tested with latest wordpress version 3.4.2, but it should work with other versions also.<\/p>",
