                "description": "<p>BBU&#8217;s RSS Feed Campaign Tagger, as the name implies, allows you to tag links in your WordPress RSS feed. It readies the links in the RSS feed for tracking with Google Analytics.<\/p>\n\n<p>Email, banner ads, pay per click, you name it. Marketers are tracking clicks like crazy to determine goals and conversions.<\/p>\n\n<p>But what about RSS feed?<\/p>\n\n<p>How many RSS subscribers who click on your link(s) and buy your product, send a donation, etc?<\/p>\n\n<p>How responsive your RSS subscribers are to your offer in comparison to your e-newsletter subscribers?<\/p>\n\n<p>This is exactly the kind of problem BBU&#8217;s RFCT solves. No, currently it is far from perfect but early tests on my blog and a few other friends look promising.<\/p>\n\n<p>Go to BBU's <a href=\"http:\/\/blogbuildingu.com\/software\/rss-feed-campaign-tagger\" title=\"BBU's RSS Feed Campaign Tagger plugin page\">RSS Feed Campaign Tagger<\/a> plugin page for complete information.<\/p>",
