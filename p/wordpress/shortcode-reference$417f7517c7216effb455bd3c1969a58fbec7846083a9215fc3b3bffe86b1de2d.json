When you're editing your content. And it won't skip the details: it'll show you what its origin is. \nMost of all, if it's available in the sourcecode, the documentation will be shown.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin is largely based on <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/book.reflection.php\">PHP5's Reflection functionality<\/a>, and therefore only available from PHP version 5.0.0.<\/p>",
