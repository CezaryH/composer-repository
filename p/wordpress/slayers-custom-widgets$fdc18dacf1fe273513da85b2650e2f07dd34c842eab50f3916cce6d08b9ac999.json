By default, all widgets appear wherever the sidebar is loaded within your theme. With this plugin, you can configure where widgets are displayed on a per post or per WP Template(Using conditional Tags) basis.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Instead of writing a longer description here's what others say:<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>\"Wow amazing plugin, I have been needing this in a long time... first step to remove the recent posts from front page but put them on the rest... thanks!\"<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>\"Currently writing a review of the plugin for Performancing.com and I get psyched up while writing it. With this plugin, you practically added the functionality to WordPress that Joomla has had for quite some time with regards to module assignments. Instead of modules in WordPress, people can assign Widgets. This is great.\"<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p",
