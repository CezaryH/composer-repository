                "description": "<p>Quick Sticky is a very simple plugin for WordPress that makes it easier to quickly feature or &#8220;sticky&#8221; posts from the posts overview screen. It is a huge time saver when dealing with sticky posts.<\/p>\n\n<p>On occasions I have also created sites where I have only wanted one sticky post at a time. The plugin contains a filter which allows you to enable this behaviour. Simply add the following snippet of code to your theme functions.php file:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>add_filter(&#039;qs_one_post_only&#039;, &#039;__return_true&#039;);<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Once enabled, toggling a post as sticky will un-sticky (or un-feature) all of the other posts.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/scott.ee\/\" title=\"Freelance WordPress web development Guildford, Surrey\">a plugin by Scott Evans<\/a><\/p>",
