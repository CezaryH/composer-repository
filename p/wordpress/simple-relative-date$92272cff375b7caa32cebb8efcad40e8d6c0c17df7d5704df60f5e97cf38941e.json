This plugin can:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Replace the_date() in the post<\/li>\n<li>Replace get_comment_date() or comment_date() in the comments<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Note that if your theme is writing the date in a different form, it won't work. You have to\nreplace its function call to one of the above (in the TwentyTen theme for example, replace twentyten_posted_on()\nby the_date().<\/p>\n\n<p>Also important to say that, comment replacement won't work if you are using the default wp comment renderer because\nit calls get_comment_time() as well. You have to do a customized callback function to use with\nwp_list_comments( array( 'callback' =&#62; 'your_customized_function_here' ) ). (ok, maybe things were not\nsimplified that much :\/)<\/p>\n\n<p>There is a options page (under settings in the Admin) where you can choose which dates",
