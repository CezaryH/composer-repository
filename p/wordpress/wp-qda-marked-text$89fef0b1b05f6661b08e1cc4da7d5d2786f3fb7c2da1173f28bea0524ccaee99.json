                "description": "<p>WP-QDA Marked Text is a plugin for Wordpress designed for rudimentary Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA).  While there are a number of highly developed programs available for Qualitative Data Analysis (e.g., see here), much of that software is problematic for end users for one of several reasons:<\/p>\n\n<p>*QDA software is often very expensive (ranging from $100s to $1000s)\n*QDA software can be difficult to use and may have many features the average user does not need\n*QDA software is often platform dependent, meaning it either runs on Windows or Mac, but rarely on Linux<\/p>\n\n<p>WP-QDA aims to address all three of these problems.  First, it's free (though it does require a web server).  Second, it is very rudimentary - you can code text into nodes\/categories and retrieve the text coded into those categories.  That's it.  Third, it runs on a web server, which means it is compatible with any platform that has a web browser.  If you're looking for free software that is platform independent ",
