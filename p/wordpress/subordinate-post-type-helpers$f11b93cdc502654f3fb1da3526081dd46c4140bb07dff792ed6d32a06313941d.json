                "description": "<p>This plugin provides a number of helpers functions to aid in the creation of subordinate relationships between two post types, one-to-many relationships in which posts of one type are children of another. (For example, a Job Listing might have a Company as a parent; a Meeting might have a Group.) With this plugin activated, developers can easily write code in their plugins and themes to register two post types related in this manner.<\/p>\n\n<p>For an example on how to use the functions this plugin makes available, check out my Groups and Meetings plugin on Github:<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/randyhoyt\/mythsoc-groups\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/github.com\/randyhoyt\/mythsoc-groups<\/a><\/li><\/ul>",
