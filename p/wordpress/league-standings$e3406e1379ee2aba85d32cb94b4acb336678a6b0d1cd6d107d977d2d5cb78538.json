Standings tables are highly configurable. Each column (field) may be hidden and each column may be re-labeled, so fields can be re-purposed for various uses. Site defaults may be set in the Admin Display Settings page but they can be over-ridden by [shortcode] arguements for each individual table. See my development site for some examples <a href=\"http:\/\/shoalsummitsolutions.com\/dev\/league-standings\/\">Shoal Summit Solutions Dev Site<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>The following features enhance the user experience on both the front and back ends:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited Number of Teams and Leagues - may be created. Historical (final) results can be saved.<\/li>\n<li>Highly configurable standings tables - ",
