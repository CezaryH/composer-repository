The file generates each time someone visits your site's front page. This shouldn't be an issue with server overload, unless you get a LOT of traffic. If you notice slowness due to this plugin, let me know.<\/p>\n\n<p>The XML generated will be located in a folder called 'xmlfiles' within your wp-content folder. The file will be named multipost.xml.<\/p>",
