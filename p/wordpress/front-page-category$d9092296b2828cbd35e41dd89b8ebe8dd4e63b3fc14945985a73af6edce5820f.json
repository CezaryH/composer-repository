If there are some category that you don't want to appear on front page, especially uncategorized one, just simple go to Settings section, click at Front Page Category and uncheck those categories.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is extremely useful useful if you use an automated posting system, or posting through mail. In this case, you can assign these posts to a category of your choice and uncheck it at Front Page Category settings. As the result they don't appear on the front page, but do appear in a category page.<\/p>",
