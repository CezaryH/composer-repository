Hate wasting server resources?<\/p>\n\n<p>Replytocom Controller gives you the option to remove \"?replytocom\" from comment urls and optionally redirect visitors &#38; bots who try to use it anyway to a destination of your choice.<\/p>\n\n<p>For those concerned about duplicate content for SEO purposes, the benefits should be obvious.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want to speed up your Wordpress server, the redirection will let you stop wasting resources serving up the same page over and over again to a crawler bot. Even worse, pages with a question mark in the url aren't typically cached by caching plugins like WP Super Cache. That means that those bot crawls are eating up way more resources then a normal url would. Now you can send them to a cached copy of that page, a less resource intensive page, or any other url.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, the cost of all this is that visitors can't have JavaScript turned off if they want to leave replies in threaded comments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Borrows code from",
