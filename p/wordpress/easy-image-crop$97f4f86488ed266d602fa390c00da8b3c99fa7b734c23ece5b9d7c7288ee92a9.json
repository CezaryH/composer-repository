Just download the plugin, install and active. No code or other customizations needed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once installed log in to Wordpress as a user with edit_posts permission and browse you website. The plugin adds a little icon to every image that can be cropped through the interface.

Drag the image around to place it and drag the bottom right corner of the resize box to resize the image. When happy, click the crop icon and you are done!
