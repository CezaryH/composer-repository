Especially things that are boring. So with that in mind I needed an easy way for clients to add their own galleries to WordPress, and I find the Media Library lacking. Since most companies have Facebook these days--and I work at a social media company--I decided to integrate Facebook albums into WordPress. And I wanted a really easy way for clients to be able to do this themselves. So I can continue to build things.<\/p>\n\n<p>That being said, this is currently a work in progress. It's a work in progress that I'm using on client sites, but its still not perfect. I'll be adding more to make it so as the days\/weeks\/months\/years\/worlds go on.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Current Capabilities:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<l",
