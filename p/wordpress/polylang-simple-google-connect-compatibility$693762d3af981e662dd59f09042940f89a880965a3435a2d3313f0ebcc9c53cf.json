                "description": "<p>When both Polylang and Simple Google Connect are active, there might occur a conflict when trying to log in with Google credentials. This is caused by a redirect on the home page (depending on Polylang settings) that interferes with the oauth2callback authorization process.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin ensures smooth operation when both Polylang and Simple Google Connect are active, no matter what Polylang settings you use. There are no options, just install and activate.<\/p>\n\n<p>This extension might also take care of compatibility between Polylang and other plugins that use oauth2callback but this is untested. Please report your findings on the Support page.<\/p>",
