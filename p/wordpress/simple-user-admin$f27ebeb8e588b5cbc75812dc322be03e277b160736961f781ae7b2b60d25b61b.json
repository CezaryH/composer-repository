                "description": "<p>Simple user admin is a WordPress MultiSite plugin that gives site administrators a simpler interface to manage blogs and users. The plugin allows you to search for users and blogs, see the blogs that a particular user has access to, and users that have access to a particular blog. You can add users to a blog, or add blogs to a user. You can also easily change roles for a user for all their blogs, or change roles for all users of a particular blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin also makes use of the __() function to allow for easy translation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many thanks to Joost from <a href=\"http:\/\/yoast.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/yoast.com\/<\/a> for fixing the plugin to work with MultiSite. Also thanks to Adam Dunson of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cloudspace.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.cloudspace.com<\/a> for lots of development work.<\/p>",
