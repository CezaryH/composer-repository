Visitors comming through search engines can land on a post that is several years old. \nOld posts were very likely great by the time they were poublished, but can be out of date or even wrong by the time they are read several years later.\nAs a lot of people don't read the post date, this plug in alert them that the post is old. \nwp-oldpost is a good complement to plugins like \"related post\", \"archives\" and so on.\nIn its current form the plugin is very rough, no admin, fix periods (one year\/more than 6 months)...<\/p>",
