The slideshow is set to pause when the user hovers over the slideshow images, giving them ample time to click the link.<\/p>\n\n<p>Images can also be deleted via the plugins Administration page.<\/p>\n\n<p>For screenshots, more information and updates, please visit:\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shrawasti.com\/about\/development-center\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.shrawasti.com\/about\/development-center\/<\/a><\/p>",
