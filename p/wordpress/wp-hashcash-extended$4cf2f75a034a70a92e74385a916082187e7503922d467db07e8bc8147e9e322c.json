It works because your visitors must use obfuscated javascript to submit a proof-of-work that indicates they opened your website in a web browser, not a robot. If the javascript check fails, WP Hashcash now gives you three options; it can either put the comment into moderation (default), put the comment in the akismet queue, or delete it.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can read more at the <a href=\"http:\/\/azizmb.com\/2012\/04\/wp-hashcash-now-working-on-newer-wordpress-versions\/\">WP Hashcash plugin<\/a> page.  WP Hashcash is 100% GPL compatible.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Blocks all comment spam, but not real comments<\/li>\n<li>Also prevents most trackback \/ pingback spam<\/li>\n<li>Also protects signup pages for Wordpress (WP), BuddyPress (BP), and Wordpress Multi-User (WPMU)<\/li>\n<li>Widget support to display spam statistics and edit the configuration<\/li>\n<li>Works with IE, Firefox, and Safari<\/l",
