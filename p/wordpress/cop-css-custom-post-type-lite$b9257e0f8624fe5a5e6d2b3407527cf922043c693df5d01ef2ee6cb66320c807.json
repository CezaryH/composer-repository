By default this is only the administrator.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Shortcodes<\/h4>\n\n<p>Shortcodes are now processed during compilation of your css.<\/p>\n\n<p>An new shortcode has been added called:<\/p>\n\n<p>[meta key=\"(name of arbitrary custom field)\" post_id=\"(optional)\"]<\/p>\n\n<p>This allows you to define a whatever custom fields you like on an individual css post and use them in your css.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ex. a { color: [meta key=\"my_color\"]; }<\/p>\n\n<p>So you can define common elements and use them throughout your css.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you like you can use the option post_id to put those values from another post. So you can have one master css post with your primary colors and such and referance it in other posts.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Credits<\/h4>\n\n<p>Minif",
