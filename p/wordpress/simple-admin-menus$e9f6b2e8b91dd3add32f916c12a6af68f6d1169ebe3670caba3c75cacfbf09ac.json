                "description": "<p>This plugin is for WordPress developers working with clients and for people who want minimalism in WordPress admin. It hides unwanted or least used menus from WordPress admin to reduce clutter. For example, if you don't want your client to play with WordPress settings, change theme or add plugins you can hide them. If you don't use tools or users or links menu often you can hide them.<\/p>\n\n<p>The hidden menus can be viewed again by deactivating the plugin and each menu item is visible by directly visiting the URL. So, there is no risk and yet it is not completely tamper proof for the clients. The main idea is to reduce clutter in WordPress admin and it be used for this purpose only.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are white label CMS plugins and user role plugins which offer similar features but this is a simple plugin that just does one thing well.<\/p>",
