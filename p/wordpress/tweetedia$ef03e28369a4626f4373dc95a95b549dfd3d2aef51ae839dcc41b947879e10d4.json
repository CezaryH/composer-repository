Add our tweetedia(tm) widget to your page and you add the real time stream so your readers can see all the latest Tweets. The interface gives you the tools to find the interesting content on Twitter, add contributors, search Twitter by keyword and hashtag, publish only the tweets you want and black list users. You can manage down to the individual tweet or set the system to 'autopilot' - you have the controls.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition, your readers never have to leave your page to join the conversation - they can tweet right from the widget.<\/p>\n\n<p>We also share ad revenue with you. The more traffic you have the more revenue you get.<\/p>\n\n<p>We are always looking to improve our widget. #tweetedia with suggestions or email us at <a href=\"mailto:iwantthis@tweetedia.com\">iwantthis@tweetedia.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>",
