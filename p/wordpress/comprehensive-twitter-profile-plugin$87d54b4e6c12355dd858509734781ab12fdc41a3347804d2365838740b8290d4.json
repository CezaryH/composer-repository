                "description": "<p>A highly configurable and comprehensive Twitter profile plugin that installs as a widget. The widget will display up to 30 profile tweets. Some of the cool widget settings allow you to display tweets in real time or simply in the loop. Widget comes with variety of options that let you style it to fit your blog theme. In order to provide better user experience when configuring the widget, cute colour picker was included for colour selections.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please note: \nAlthough I try my best to release a bug-free code, one or two may slip through. It would be so cool and I would really appreciate it \nif you would report any bugs to me first at <a href=\"http:\/\/initbinder.com\/plugins\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/initbinder.com\/plugins<\/a>, before reporting the plugin to be broken. I am quick to respond. \nThanks!<\/p>",
