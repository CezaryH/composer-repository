On any \"listing\" page other than the homepage it will switch to showing you bars for posts in the current \"section\" and a line for all posts. This allows you to see how active the current section is in comparison to the blog as a whole.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently tested on the homepage, tags and category pages.<\/p>\n\n<p>Comes packaged as a widget, or you can use the template tag to insert it directly into a theme file.<\/p>",
