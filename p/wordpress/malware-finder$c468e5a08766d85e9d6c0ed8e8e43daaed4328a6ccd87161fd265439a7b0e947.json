But most likely you have access to at least one file (i.e. your homepage) that has been infected with malicious code.  Just paste a small piece of that code below and the plugin will search through your entire Wordpress installation, providing the EXACT locations of the infected files!  Please note that you WILL NOT be able to use this plugin if you are UNABLE to access your Wordpress Dashboard.<\/p>",
