Using the COOKIE_KEY of the former Prestashop installation, it'll verify if the password is correct and, only in that case, it'll rehash the password using Wordpress' default hashing algorithm and insert the new password to the database. Then it'll try logging in.<\/p>\n\n<p>In every other case, login will function normally, so if there is an error, it'll be returned.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a while, every former Prestashop user you have imported to your WP DB will have their passwords securely rehashed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tested with Prestashop 1.3.5 and Wo",
