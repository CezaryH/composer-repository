                "description": "<p>This is an updated version of the popular <em>WordPress Firewall<\/em> plugin, with fixes for all known bugs and a few new features!<\/p>\n\n<p>This WordPress plugin investigates web requests with simple, WordPress-specific heuristics, to identify and stop the most obvious attacks. There are a few powerful, generic modules that do this; but they're not always installed on web servers, and usually difficult to configure.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin intelligently whitelists and blacklists pathological-looking phrases, based on which field they appear within, in a page request (unknown\/numeric parameters vs. known post bodies, comment bodies, etc.). Its purpose is not to replace prompt and responsible upgrading, but rather to mitigate 0-day attacks and let bloggers sleep better at night.<\/p>\n\n<p>Originally developed by SEO Egghead and released as <em>WordPress Firewall<\/em>.<\/p>",
