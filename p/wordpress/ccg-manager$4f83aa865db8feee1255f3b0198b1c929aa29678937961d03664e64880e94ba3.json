It's based off of desktop apps like Magic Suitcase which store your card collections and allow you to search through your inventory.&#160;<\/p>\n\n<p>Using custom post types and taxonomies, you can store information about your cards, sort them by series, and split them into collections. Collections could be based on whatever criteria you like -- some examples could be to split them by game, decks, etc.<\/p>",
