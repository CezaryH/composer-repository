                "description": "<p>A very useful and simple plug-in that allows you to hide a part of a post (links,image...) using standard HTML comment markers &#60;!-- and --&#62;. When Wordpress converts your post text into HTML, one thing it does it converts a double-hyphen to an en-dash (&#8211; which in Unicode is &#038;&#035;8211;). This plug-in simply changed it back if it happens to be followed by a greater than symbol. Since --&#62; is a HTML end-comment marker, this allows HTML comments to work again.<\/p>\n\n<p>To hide a text,just place it between those two markers &#60;!-- and --&#62;. For example:<\/p>\n\n<p>This is an example of a post with &#60;!-- Hey, what are you looking at? --&#62; hidden text.<\/p>",
