Or you might have some other HTML, CSS or JavaScript you&#8217;d like to include with every post. Now&#8217;s your chance. With In The Loop you can easily add any code you like to your posts and pages, and not have to do any messy edits to your theme files either.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin provides an options panel with two input boxes. One is for content you want to appear before your post, the other for after it. Each box comes with a set of options to control whether to show it on Teasers, Single Posts, Pages, The Feed and whether or not to execute PHP.<\/p>",
