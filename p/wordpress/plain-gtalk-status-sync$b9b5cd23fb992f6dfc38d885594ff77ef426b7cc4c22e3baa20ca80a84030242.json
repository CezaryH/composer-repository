You can set a max-shown number and the cache interval to make it works more smoothly.<\/p>\n\n<p>FYI:The principle of this plugin is to refine your GTalk badge page, which is the only way to fetch your GTalk status information. Google did not provide any open API for GTalk status and it seems there would be no official API for a while.<\/p>",
