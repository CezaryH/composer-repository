This Plugin automates things by removing and replacing characters such as hyphens, and underscores, with spaces. The title can then be capitalized by a method of your choice:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>First letter of each word capitalized.<\/li>\n<li>First letter of first word capitalized only.<\/li>\n<li>All letters made uppercase.<\/li>\n<li>All letter made lower case.<\/li>\n<li>No capitalization. Title remains unchanged.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>You will especially benefit from this Plugin if your media files have descitpive names, as you won't have to manually edit them at all after uploading them!<\/p>\n\n<p>Future versions of this Plugin will include:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>More choice of characters to remove.<\/li>\n<li>Optionally mirror the formatted title to the Alt text too.<\/li>\n<li>Batch format media existing media library titles. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Please rate 'Format Media Titles' if you find it useful, thanks.<\/p>\n\n<p>See ",
