                "description": "<p>This plugin requires the <a href=\"http:\/\/wpml.org\">WPML<\/a> plugin to be installed and active. WPML comes with a native redirection feature based on browser language detection, but it doesn't work if you are using a caching plugin like <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/w3-total-cache\/\">W3 Total Cache<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/wp-super-cache\/\">WP Super Cache<\/a>, because the language detection and redirection is made at PHP level, and when serving cached pages that code is not executed at all.\nThis plugin is a workaround for this limitation, as it implements language redirection through javascript, so it can work even in presence of caching plugins.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: This is a BETA release, but you can safely try it, since the plugin only adds a javascript behavior and it doesn't change the contents of your site in any way. If you encounter any issues please report them in the <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/plugin\/black-studio-wpml-javascript-r",
