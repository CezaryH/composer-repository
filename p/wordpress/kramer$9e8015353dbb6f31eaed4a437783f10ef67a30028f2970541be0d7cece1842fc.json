                "description": "<p>Kramer will add inbound links to a post on your weblog as pingbacks without the need for the author of the post on blog A to send a ping to blog B by using both Technorati and by monitoring incoming referrers.<\/p>\n\n<p>What this means is that pingback, trackback and other post-pinging tools are no longer required, as all links to a post will be found and shown as pingbacks.  To show links to the main weblog, or to other pages in general, a function called <code>kramer_inbound()<\/code> is provided. It can be used in Wordpress templates to display a list of the latest inbound links to that page.  It is usually included in the sidebar of a blog and can be fully configured via the Kramer administration interface.<\/p>",
