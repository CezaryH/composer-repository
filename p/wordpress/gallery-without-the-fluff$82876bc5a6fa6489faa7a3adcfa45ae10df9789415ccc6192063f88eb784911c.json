You won't find an options page with lots of fancy jQuery effects like colorbox or masonry here. That's the point. If you want to control which jQuery script you use to style your gallery, that other stuff just gets in the way.<\/p>\n\n<p>This simple plugin gives you the ability to add images from your media library to galleries that you create, and order the images in each gallery with an easy drag-and-drop interface. You can also update the titles, captions and other meta info of the images in your gallery in one bulk action. Then you can use a shortcode to show your galleries in any page, post or text widget. You can also call the gallery directly from a theme file.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lastly, and most importantly, you can customise the markup and variables that will be outputted with the gallery so you get exactly what yo",
