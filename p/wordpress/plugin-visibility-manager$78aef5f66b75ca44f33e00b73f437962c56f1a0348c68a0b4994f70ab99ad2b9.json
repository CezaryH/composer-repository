Plugins can be made hidden or visible on a blog by blog basis (through the plugins menu). It is also possible to specify plugins that will be available for all site on the Network Admin plugins page.<\/p>\n\n<p>Plugins can be active even if they are invisible, but this can only be controlled by Super Admins. Blog administrators can only de\/activate visible plugins. (Note: plugin settings page are not affected by the plugin visibility manager.)<\/p>\n\n<p>The Plugin Visibility Manager automatically makes itself invisible.<\/p>",
