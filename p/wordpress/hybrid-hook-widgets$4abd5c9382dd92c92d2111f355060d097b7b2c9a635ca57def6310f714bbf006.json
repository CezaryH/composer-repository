Basically, it allows you to add widgets pretty much anywhere.<\/p>\n\n<p>Typically, to add extra stuff to the theme, you must use one of <em>Hybrid's<\/em> action hooks.  This can be quite confusing to some users.  This plugin was created mainly for those users without much XHTML and PHP knowledge.  It allows them to take advantage of <em>Hybrid's<\/em> advanced hook system without the need to understand how it works.  Of course, even advanced users can take advantage of this, especially when dealing with client work.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is for <strong>WordPress 2.8+ only<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>You must have the <a href=\"http:\/\/themehybrid.com\/themes\/hybrid\">Hybrid theme<\/a> installed to use it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Full instructions for use can be found in the plugin's <code>readme.html<\/code> file, which is included",
