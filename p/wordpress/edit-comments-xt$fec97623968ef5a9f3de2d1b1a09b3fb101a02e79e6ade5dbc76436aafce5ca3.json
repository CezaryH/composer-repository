                "description": "<p>Edit Comments XT is a simple WordPress plugin that allows commenters to edit their own comments. To edit a comment, a user must have the same IP address as the user that made the comment and they must also make the edit within a specific time frame. The default edit time window is 30 minutes, but it can be changed easily in the plugin&#8217;s option page.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re logged in to WordPress, it will use the more feature-enhanced wp-admin comment editing screen, but if you aren&#8217;t then it will just allow you to edit the content of your comment.<\/p>\n\n<p>Edit Comments XT is based on Andrew Sutherland&#8217;s Edit Comments plugin and works with WordPress 2.1.x and 2.2.x. Also, the security issues of Andrew&#8217;s plugin have been addressed &#38; resolved.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/sw-guide.de\/wordpress\/plugins\/edit-comments-xt\/\" title=\"Edit Comments XT\">the official website<\/a> for further details and the latest information on this plugin.<\/p>",
