You can use password-protection on Pages and Posts, but those need to be set individually.\nIt's far simpler to just write a Post, specify a category and all posts in that category are password protected. Or you might decide to protect a lot of old posts.\nImagine a family blog where certain posts are only visible to people who know the birthday of your first child, or remember your pet's name.\nCat-Pass is not for super-sensitive information, it's for casual use.<\/p>",
