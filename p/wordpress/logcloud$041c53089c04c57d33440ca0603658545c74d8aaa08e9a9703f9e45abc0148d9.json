                "description": "<p>LogCloud provides a shortcode that generates a tag cloud with logarithm scaled font sizes.<\/p>\n\n<p>LogCloud displays a tag cloud much like the built-in Wordpress tag cloud, except that instead \nof scaling the font sizes linearly, the sizes are scaled using a logarithm scale.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you use your tags with approximately equal frequency, the normal linear scale works just \nfine. However, if you tag your posts such that just a few tags predominate, the linear scale \nresults in one or two very large looking tags in your cloud, and everything else will use a \ncouple of font sizes at the lower end of the scale. A log scale cloud will result in a more \neven distribution for this situation.<\/p>",
