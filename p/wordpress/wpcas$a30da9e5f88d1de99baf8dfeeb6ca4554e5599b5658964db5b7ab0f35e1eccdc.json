Its purpose is to permit a user to log into multiple applications simultaneously and automatically. It also allows untrusted web applications to authenticate users without gaining access to a user's security credentials, such as a password. The name CAS also refers to a software package that implements this protocol.<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Users who attempt to login to WordPress are redirected to the central CAS sign-on screen. After the user's credentials are verified, s\/he is then redirected back to the WordPress site. If the CAS username matches the WordPress username, the user is recognized as valid and allowed access.<\/p>\n\n<",
