Unfortunately dropdown menus do not work well with mobile \/ touch devices, because the \"mouseover\" event is not handled, so when the user click a top level menu, the browser follows the link instead of opening the dropdown menu. This plugin is a solution for that. On touch devices, the first click (tap) on a top level menu only expands the nested dropdown menu, while the second click goes to the link. This is the same behavior natively adopted by iPad \/ iPhone since iOS 5, so this plugin is intended to work with previous versions of iOS and with other mobile platforms that do not have such native behavior (Android, etc).<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: This is a BETA release, but you can safely try it, since the plugin only adds a javascript behavior on menus ",
