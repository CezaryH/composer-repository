It tweets in this format: [your message] [post title] [short url].<\/p>\n\n<p>On the options page you will have to enter your twitter username and password. You can also configure your message there.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you try to publish a bunch of posts quickly Bird Feeder url shortening service will not handle them and result un-expected tweets. Your mileage may vary. Don't spam.<\/p>\n\n<p>Current: 1.2.3<\/p>",
