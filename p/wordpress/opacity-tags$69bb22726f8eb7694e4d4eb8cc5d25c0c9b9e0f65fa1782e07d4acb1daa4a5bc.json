Check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xxmpYhmMIAQ\">demo video<\/a> below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>What that means is that the most popular tags are first in the tag list and closer to full opacity. The less popular tags each have less and less opacity, fading into the background of your site.<\/p>\n\n<p>Opacity Tags provides a tag cloud that you can have more control over, is more beautiful, and is better at quickly telling users what tags are the most popular.<\/p>",
