Unfortunatelly there is no option to offer your web visitors list of all tags. And that is purpose of this plugin.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin adds a new shortcode <code>[get_tags]<\/code> that will generate a table with all tags. This table consists of two columns, in the first one you find tag name, which also serves as a link to the articles tagged in it. The second column contains count, how many times the tag is used.<\/p>\n\n<p>The table is sortable by both columns, just by clicking on the header of the column. Sorting is provided by JavaScript, so no reloading of page.<\/p>\n\n<p>Graphical style of the table is fully managed by CSS (cascade style sheets), so you can easily override the default lookout just by new CSS values after calling <code>wp_head();<\/code> in your theme header.<\/p>\n\n<p>Th",
