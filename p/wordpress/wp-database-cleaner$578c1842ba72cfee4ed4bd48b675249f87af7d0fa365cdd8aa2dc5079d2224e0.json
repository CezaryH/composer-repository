It is not good to have 10k spam comments saved in the database, because all of these comments can increase consistently the size of the mysql database backups.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you have a lot of published posts, you may have post revisions and auto-drafts saved in the database, that can slow down the database performances. All this data is considered junk and it should be cleaned frequently.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Key Features<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Delete post revisions<\/li>\n<li>Delete auto drafts<\/li>\n<li>Delete pending comments<\/li>\n<li>Delete spam comments<\/li>\n<li>Delete trash comments<\/li>\n<li>Delete t",
