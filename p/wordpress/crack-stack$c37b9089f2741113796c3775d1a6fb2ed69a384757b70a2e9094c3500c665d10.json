                "description": "<p>Some modern browsers (such as Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer) when the page loads restrict the number of simultaneous connections to a single host. This leads to the creation of a queue of connections and slows speed of download site content. And the more you have external elements on the page, the longer the queue and more time opening the page.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin allows you to automatically reallocate external resources at various pseudo-domains. This removes the limitation on the number of connections and increases the speed of loading pages.<\/p>\n\n<p>In some cases this can speed up the download images, CSS-styles and JS-scripts in 4 times!<\/p>\n\n<p>Warning! Your server should correctly convert the queries to non-existent domains, discarding the prefix added by the plugin. Please, before using the plugin configure your server.<\/p>",
