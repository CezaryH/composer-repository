It provides a widget which lets you get more options than the default WordPress category widget (show RSS, hide empty categories, etc.). Furthermore, it allows to hide the children categories and use clickable buttons to expand them. The plugin requires jQuery to be included in your theme. It degrades nicely when javascript is not available to the usual WordPress category list.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/enhanced-links.vincentprat.info\">plugin home page<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>I need translators for the plugin, this is not a hard task, just a file to translate. Please contact me if you want to translate. Currently available in English and French.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is available under the GPL license, which means that it's free.
