This plugin makes it SUPER easy to reuse fragments of content (i.e. Snippets). Snippets can be included in other Posts\/Pages\/Widgets via Shortcodes. This is a very lightweight plugin!<\/p>\n\n<p>After installing this plugin, create a new Snippet (find menu item on the left in your Dashboard). Give your Snippet a Slug (i.e. under the title of your Snippet). Once you have a Snippet and a Slug, you can include your Snippet anywhere you like &#8212; in other Posts\/Pages\/Widgets (and even inside PHP template files).<\/p>\n\n<p>Using a Snippet that you've created in the WP Editor. Follow this simple Shortcode syntax.<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>[snippet slug=\"my-cool-snippet\" \/]\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Using a Snippet that you've created inside a PHP template file.<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&#60;?php echo do_shortcode('[snippet slug=\"my-cool-snippet\" \/]'); ?&#62;\n<\/code><\/pre>",
