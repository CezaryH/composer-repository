The MediaBugs WordPress plugin is intended for bloggers who are doing journalism on their sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>With the plugin installed, site visitors will have one-click access to an error report form that appears as an overlay, pulls in the post's URL automatically, and files the error report to MediaBugs.org. Blog publishers can easily monitor MediaBugs for any error reports filed about their sites by subscribing to email alerts or RSS feeds.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can find out more about MediaBugs at <a href=\"http:\/\/mediabugs.org\">MediaBugs.org<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Plugin author: Ben Brown\nMediaBugs director: Scott Rosenberg<\/p>",
