For those looking to take a trip back to simpler times in black and white with a good ol' fashioned fixed-width (that's pixels baby) design that looks the exact same across all devices, this is the theme for you. Grayscale is a minimalist theme and void of some common design standards such as dropdown menus as a conscious design choice with \"the simpler, the better\" in mind. If you need a theme stocked with such common features out-of-the-box, this theme will not suit your needs. Thank you. - Official Support Forum: bryanhadaway.com\/forum\/projects",
