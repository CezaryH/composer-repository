                "description": "<p>Login Encrypt is a security plugin. It uses a complex combination of DES and RSA.\nIt was first developed by ELSERVER for securing login in the hosting control panel, and then released as a WordPress plugin.<\/p>\n\n<p>The way it works (fast explanation):\n*   A Javascript appended to the wp-login generates, each time a user logs in, a unique DES key. Using that key, the password of the user is encrypted.\n*   The Javascript encrypts the DES unique key using the RSA public key (generated when the plugin is activated).\n*   The encripted password and the encrypted DES unique key are sended to the server.\n*   A hook when login in checks if a encrypted DES unique key is received. If does, decrypts it using the secure RSA private key.\n*   Then, decrypts the password using the DES unique key.<\/p>",
