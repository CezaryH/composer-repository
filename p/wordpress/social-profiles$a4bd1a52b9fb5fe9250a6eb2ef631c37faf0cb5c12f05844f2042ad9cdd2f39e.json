Upon activation, you choose which social networks will be shown on your site and the plugin creates a corresponding box on the user profile page. All a user needs to do is enter their username. The plugin will automatically create a link to their profile based on that username &#8211; in graphical or textual form based on your preferences<\/p>\n\n<p>More info:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sugarrae.com\/wordpress\/social-profiles\/\">Social Profiles<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Other <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sugarrae.com\/wordpress\/\">WordPress Plugins<\/a> by Sugarrae.<\/li>\n<\/ul>",
