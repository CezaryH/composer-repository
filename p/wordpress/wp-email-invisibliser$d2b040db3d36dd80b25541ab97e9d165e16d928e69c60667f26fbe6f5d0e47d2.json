It simply removes readable emails from the html outpout, replaces them with a span element that uses the hex converted email address in a class and then replaces that span element with javascript on the fly to create a clickable link. If the viewers browser is not javascript enabled they will see a short message explaining why they can't see the email.<\/p>",
