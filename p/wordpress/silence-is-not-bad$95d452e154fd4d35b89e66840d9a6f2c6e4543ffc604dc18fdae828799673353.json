Also why show admin bar for Subscriber? Of course they are right,Silence Is Not Bad. I decide remove them,  only core users can view these notices, my new plugin --  \"Silence Is Not Bad\" will allow us allow\/disallow these notice or admin notice bar based on different roles<\/p>\n\n<p>It is easy, you just select user group, only checked user group will view admin bar on front end, or get notice of wordpress upgrade, or found their plugin &#38; theme have new updates.<\/p>",
