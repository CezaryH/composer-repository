Now you can too.<\/p>\n\n<p>When a user types <em>barrel roll<\/em> into any text filed on the page (for example, in the phrase 'do a barrel roll'), the page will rotate 360 degrees and come to rest as it was. Try it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Feel free to contact me for  <a href='http:\/\/bryan.co.il\/barrelroll\/poems.php'>Barrel Roll support and comments<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can also <a href='http:\/\/bryan.co.il\/barrelroll\/poems.php'>Send in a Poem<\/a>. It makes me feel appreciated and I may even include it in the readme file of future versions.<\/p>",
