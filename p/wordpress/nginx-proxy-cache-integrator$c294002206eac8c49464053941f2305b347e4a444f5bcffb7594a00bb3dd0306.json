It makes Wordpress emit an \"X-Accel-Expires: 0\" header when a user is logged in or has taken actions that should cause them to get a customized page on your frontend.  This - along with the nginx configuration below - will ensure logged-in users aren't impacted by your static nginx cache.<\/p>\n\n<p>Why would you want to statically cache wordpress with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nginx.org\">nginx?<\/a><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>INSANE performance. Hardware that could generate 6 pages \/ second can now generate many thousands.<\/li>\n<li>Low resource usage. Even on very busy servers, nginx uses only a handful of RAM.<\/li>\n<li>Unobtrusiveness. You plop nginx in front of wordpress and that's pretty much it. This plugin (and nginx) is all you need to make your site digg- and slashdot- proof.<\/li>\n<li>Stability. Nginx is rock solid.<\/li>\n<li>Faster is better. All the web gurus agree - ",
