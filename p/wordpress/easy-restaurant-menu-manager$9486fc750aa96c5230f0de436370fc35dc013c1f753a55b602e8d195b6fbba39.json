Easy Restaurant Menu Manager makes it simple to add and update all your dishes in a way that's easy for your site's visitors to read and easy for you to maintain. You can add categories like appetizers, entrees or desserts -- name them whatever you want -- and set the order those categories should display in. Include a description for each item, and decide whether or not you want to display the price. Want to tweak the display? Add CSS right from the plugin, without fiddling with theme files. This plugin isn't just for restaurants. Spas, service stations and others can use it to share their menu of services.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/labs.saidigital.co\/products\/easy-restaurant-menu-manager-wordpress\/\">Project Homepage<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/labs.saidigital.co\/products\/easy-restaurant-menu-manager-wordpress\/\">Extended Version<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/labs.saidigital.co\/products\/easy-restaurant-menu-manager-word",
