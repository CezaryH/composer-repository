In addition to that, those that post comments on your site\nafter signing in also have their avatars displayed and the comment form is autofilled for them.\nSSI is designed using <a href=\"http:\/\/peopletab.com\/restta.html\">RESTTA<\/a> , meaning that is a protocol\nopen to any application that implements it.<\/p>",
