                "description": "<p>WordPress's rewrite rules and query variables provide a powerful system\nfor mapping URL strings to collections of posts. Every request is parsed\ninto query variables and turned into a SQL query via <code>$wp_query-&#62;query()<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, though, you don't want to display a list of posts. You just want\na URL to map to a callback function, with the output displayed in place of\nposts in whatever theme you happen to be using.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's where WP Router comes in. It handles all the messy bits of registering\npost types, query variables, rewrite rules, etc., and lets you write code to\ndo what you want it to do. One function call is all it takes to map a\nURL to your designated callback function and display the return value in the page.<\/p>\n\n<p>Created by <a href=\"http:\/\/flightless.us\">Flightless<\/a><\/p>",
