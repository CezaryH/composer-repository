The Voight Kampff Comment Test (VKCT) plugin allows you to add additional fields to the comment forms throughout your site to check if your users are human (not spam bots), and even if they're going to leave a relvent comment. These fields can be text fields or dropdowns, and can be:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Optional - The user can enter information but isn't required to.<\/li>\n<li>Required - The user must enter information before posting a comment.<\/li>\n<li>Required and exact - The user must enter information and it must match a preset answer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This combination of fields allows you to do three things:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Enact a simple spam filter by adding a required question to your site.<\/li>\n<li>Gather ad",
