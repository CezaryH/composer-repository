The list contains posts of the same post_type as the one you are currently editing, and allows you to quickly jump between other draft and published posts. This is much less time-consuming than navigating back to the posts list and choosing the post you need.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perfect for quickly jumping between editing posts, pages and custom posts.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>No plugin settings page required, simply install and activate the plugin.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>",
