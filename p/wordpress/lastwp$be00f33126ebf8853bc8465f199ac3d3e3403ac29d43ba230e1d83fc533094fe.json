What Last.wp does is\nshow a few of the songs you just scrobbled over to Last.fm. It stands out beyond the other choices because it does it's dirty work in Javascript (which can speed up \nyour server, because it doesn't have to make request over to Last.fm every page load, rather your Guests computer does it). It displays album artwork, the song name,\nthe artist name, and the album name! Your guests will be AMAZED when they find your recent obsession with Conway Twitty! They'll gasp in awe when they see how much you\nplayed the beetles within the past five minutes, and their jaws will drop when they see you've been spinning N-Sync albums! Wait no longer, your guests can be amazed <strong>today<\/strong>!<\/p>\n\n<p>On the technical side, Last.wp is powered by a small plugin provided by the kind people over at Engage Interactive.
