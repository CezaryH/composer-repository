I wrote this for the NY Times Regional Media group because we have what seems like thousands of blogs and we're the admin for each and every one. There are admins at the newspapers that do need the notifications, however, so I wrote this in order to stop the flow of emails (appx 300 per day!) coming to just our admin address.<\/p>",
