The socket fallback only worked on one of the two servers I am currently using to test the plugin when I triggered it. It works flawlessly using cURL on both my servers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Planned for next release:\n* <strong>Twitter Support<\/strong>\n* Fix any bugs people find<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>What you need to install<\/strong>\n1. cURL or Sockets and JSON (automatically included in PHP 5.2+)\n2. Probably WP 3.2 or greater\n3. A Facebook account\n4. A Mobile Phone to verify your Facebook account when creating the Facebook App\n5. Probably",
