If you run a site with WordPress, probably some users are authors, some are contributors, and \nmost of them are only suscribers. With Friendz each user has his own profile, even if there are no public posts by that user. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, it is possible to browse in \"user lists\" (named \"User Views\" in the plugin). There is one user list included in Friendz: the \n\"all registered users\" view. You can easily define other views through the hooks used in",
