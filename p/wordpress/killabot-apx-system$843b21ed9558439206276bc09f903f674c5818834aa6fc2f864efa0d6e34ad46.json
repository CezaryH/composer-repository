Every day new websites, with unrecorded IP Addresses, \nare popping up as new Anonymous Proxy Sites. Increased popularity, easy \naccessibility and the protection of anonymity has led to an increase \nin suspicious online activity.<\/p>\n\n<p>An algorithm has been developed as an effective solution to the complex Proxy dilemma. \nThis system's results produce the most accurate way to identify anonymous proxies \nby looking through their complex characteristics. This sharply contrasts with\nmethods which rely primarily on using IP blacklists of yesterday's proxies.<\/p>",
