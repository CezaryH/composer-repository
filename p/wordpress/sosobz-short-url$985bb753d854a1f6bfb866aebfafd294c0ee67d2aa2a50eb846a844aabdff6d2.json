And the URL is displayed below the blog post. \nThese Short URLs are particular useful for twitter and alike as these services limit the messages of their users to a certain amount of characters - which leads to the situation that their users are forced to have an eye on what exactly they want to write. \nAlso this will help promote your blog.<\/p>",
