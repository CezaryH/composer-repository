This all happens automatically.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that this functionality was brought into WordPress core for version 2.1, so this plugin is not needed.  When you upgrade to WordPress version 2.1 or higher, your old slugs will be kept and will keep on being redirected without the need for this plugin.<\/p>",
