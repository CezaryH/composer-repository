This plugin adds additional features, such as IP and referer banning. It also alters the <em>Referer<\/em> column for the Admin's <em>Who's Been Online<\/em> grid, displaying the referring host name followed by the search string, if there is one. Referer links are proxified so you can click them without exposing your referring address. Long URLs are prevented from expanding the <em>Who's Been Online<\/em> grid too wide for viewing. This plugin writes to .htaccess, which is automatically backed-up before any changes are made. There are no settings required.<\/p>",
