I&#237;ve tried \nto build in some flexibility as well as ease-of-use, but there are always compromises. I look forward to your feedback \nso I can make it better. To contact me about the plugin please use <a href=\"mailto:darkroom@innerturtle.com\">darkroom@innerturtle.com<\/a> so that I know what \nyour e-mail is about.<\/p>\n\n<p>Features:\n* Captions are loaded through EXIF\/XMP tags.
