Through the settings you can set the author and categories that get assigned to the post.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to import the newsletters but show links to the archives we offer a shortcode to do that. By placing [ mailchimp ] \nanywhere in your post or page it will use the settings and grab your newsletters. You can also override the settings by adding attributes \nto your shortcode.<\/p>",
