Ultralinks can perform many of the same functions hyperlinks do, but better. Ultralinks can even do many things that hyperlinks can't do at all. They can take your website to the next level.<\/p>\n\n<p>Check out our introduction video at <a href=\"https:\/\/ultralink.me\" title=\"ultralink.me\">ultralink.me<\/a><\/p>\n\n<strong>Cleaner, Denser Content<\/strong>\n\n<p>Ultralinks are all about making the internet cleaner and less distracting. Ultralinks were designed to be unobtrusive and only have a visual callout when the user is interested in exploring them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Not only does this make for cleaner, less interrupted content, but it also means that a page can easily contain a much higher density of ultralinks than hyperlinks. All while keeping things neat and tidy.<\/p>\n\n<p>Web a",
