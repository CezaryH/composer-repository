In Matt Mullenweg's original Hello Dolly plugin, I've replaced the \"Hello, Dolly\" lyrics with those of \"Sympathy for the Devil\" by the Rolling Stones ... because I sometimes prefer dark, brooding, snarling words atop my blog admin. How about you? I'm shocked, shocked I tell you, that no one has done this before. When activated you will randomly see a lyric from Sympathy for the Devil in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.<\/p>",
