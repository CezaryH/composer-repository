Any existing affiliate links in your blog will be transformed on the fly to the links you've selected. No changes are made to the actual content of your posts, so if you choose to return to a single-affiliate mode, simply deactivate the plug-in or turn off the option to convert the affiliate links of your choice.<\/p>\n\n<p>For each book link on a page or post, BookLinker will display a tasteful DHTML pop-up window containing an image of the book cover, and links to each of the book resources you've selected. The window displays only when a visitor clicks the link, and can be dismissed with the \"Close\" l",
