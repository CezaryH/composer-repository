You can create different base dn's for every site and still have only one list of users.<\/p>\n\n<p>First of all this plugin is based upon the <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/simple-ldap-login\/installation\/\">simple LDAP Login<\/a> I made some changes which I think are handy.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you want to manage multiple single wordpress installations, password management becomes crucial. When someone's password has been cracked you would have to change it everywhere wouldn't it be simpler to just edit it on one place.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Feature request<\/h4>\n\n<p>Do you have an idea to make this plugin better, please let me know leave a message here or email me alex[at]alex-dekker.nl.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Donate?<\/h4>\n\n<p>If you want to donate please email me.<\/p>",
