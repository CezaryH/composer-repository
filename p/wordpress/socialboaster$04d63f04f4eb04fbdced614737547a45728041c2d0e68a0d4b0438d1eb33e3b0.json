It uses the Wordpress cron system and can be configured to search for updates by the hour or on a daily basis.<\/p>\n\n<p>SocialBoaster works by grabbing the contents of your Twitter Tweets, and Digg\/Del.icio.us bookmarks and creating posts for them on your blog. SocialBoaster is designed to be unobstrusive. As such, each post SocialBoaster makes will be given a metadata value in order to make SocialBoaster posts easily distinguishable from regular blog posts. You can find out more about this on the FAQ page.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can see the plugin active at: <a href=\"http:\/\/nial.me\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/nial.me\/<\/a>.
