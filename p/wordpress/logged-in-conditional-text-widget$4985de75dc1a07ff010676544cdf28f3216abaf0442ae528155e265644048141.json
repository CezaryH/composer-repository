These can be used much like the normal Text widget, except they only display if the condition is met. You can add HTML and JavaScript.<\/p>\n\n<p>The intended usage is to allow you to add a link to a Register page, along with some text promoting registration, on a site with the bbPress 2.0 plugin.<\/p>\n\n<p>You could also use this to display adverts to users who are not logged in, or useful links to users who are.<\/p>\n\n<p>Unlike the normal Text widget which just has a toggle for paragraph on\/off, this widget has four display options:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No formatting<\/li>\n<li>Add paragraphs<\/li>\n<li>Bullet list<\/li>\n<li><p>Ordered list (numbered)<\/p>\n\n<p>The additional list options are useful if you are adding a number of links - simply add each one on a new line and they'll be turned into a bullet. There's no additional styling here so they should match your other widgets.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>",
