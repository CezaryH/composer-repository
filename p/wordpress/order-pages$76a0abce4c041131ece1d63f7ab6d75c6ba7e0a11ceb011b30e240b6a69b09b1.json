If you've ever been frustrated with having to move one page's order, only to find you have to update every other pages order as well, then this plugin is for you! It's very basic at the moment. No fancy ajax drag &#38; drop, but it does the job.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin currently supports a maximum of 2 levels of Page Children (ie. Sub-Sub-Pages).<\/p>",
