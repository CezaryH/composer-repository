You can choose different display styles of either picture only or picture, username, and most recent tweet. Due to Twitter limit on API hits, I cache the friend list and only hit Twitter every 5 minutes to avoid getting \"Over the limit errors\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Version 1.1 fixes the issue that prevented the posts to update when viewed from front page of blog. Added a tweet box that allows you to post to twitter directly from the widget. Removed users that have not made a tweet in a long time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Version 1.2 fixes a couple bugs, and adds optional direct message to new followers. Adds ability to block followers from the widget<\/p>",
