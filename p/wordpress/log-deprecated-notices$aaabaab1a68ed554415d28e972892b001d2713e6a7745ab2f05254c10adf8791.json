It identifies where the deprecated functionality is being used and offers the alternative if available.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a plugin for developers. WP_DEBUG is not needed, though its general usage is strongly recommended. Deprecated notices normally exposed by WP_DEBUG will be logged instead.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin also logs incorrect function usage, which WordPress started reporting in 3.1.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please report any bugs to plugins at <a href=\"http:\/\/andrewnacin.com\/\">andrewnacin.com<\/a>, or find me in IRC #wordpress-dev or @<a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nacin\">nacin<\/a> on Twitter.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is young software. It works, but there's a lot left on the todo (check out the Other Notes tab). Have an idea? Let me know.<\/p>",
