The themes nowadays give you some areas to put the widgets, but those areas are common for all the posts that are using the same template. NOTE: <strong>You need to use a theme that accepts widgets to make this plugin work.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Custom Sidebars allows you to create all the widgetized areas you need, your own custom sidebars, configure them adding widgets, and replace the default sidebars on the posts or pages you want in just few clicks.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Last versions of the plugin requires at least Wordpress 3.3. If you are running a earlier version of Wordpress download Custom Sidebars 0.8.2<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>You can also set new default sidebars for a group of posts or pages easily, keeping the chance of changing them individually.:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sidebars for all the posts that belong to a category.<\/li>\n<li>Sidebars for all the posts that belong to a post-type.<\/li>\n<li>Sideba",
