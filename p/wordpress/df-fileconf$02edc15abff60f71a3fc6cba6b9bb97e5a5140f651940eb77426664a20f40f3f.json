This is normally done manually updating the\nvalues in the database table wp_options, since you can not reach the\nWordPress administration sites if these URLs are wrong. If you use a plugin\nthat makes use of Google Maps you need to update the API key as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin has only been tested with the WordPress 2.1 branch, but might\nwork with older versions. Please report on compatiblity with other versions.<\/p>",
