                "description": "<p>Extend the Jigoshop shipping methods by adding a basic weight method.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a very simple plugin that allows you to set weight based shipping fees. Five levels of weights are alowed.\nExample: level1 = 2kg with next field as 10 CHF = the total weight of an order in the cart is between 0kg and 2 kg and has a fee of 10 CHF.\nExample: level2 = 5 kg with next field as 20 CHF = the total weight of an order in the cart is between 2kg and 5 kg and has a fee of 20 CHF.\netc.<\/p>\n\n<p>My thanks goes to Iain at Polevaultweb, who developed a basic bundle shipping plugin for jigoshop. You can find his plugin at <a href=\"http:\/\/jigoshop.com\/product\/basic-bundle-shipping\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/jigoshop.com\/product\/basic-bundle-shipping\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.intervisio.ch\/webwork\/wordpress-plugins\/\">Plugin Page<\/a> &#124; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/gasserol\/\">@gasserol<\/a> &#124;<\/p>",
