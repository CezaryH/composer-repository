                "description": "<p>The only CAPTCHA that uses a clear, non-distorted, easy-to-read image that requires reasoning and deducing skills that only humans possess. The image cannot be read by OCR software, it cannot be brute forced (the software safe-guards itself with a 5 min lockout upon 3 failures that increases with each failure), and Super CAPTCHA Pro (starting at just 96 cents per month) uses cloud processing to pre-determine if a visitor is a spam bot and shuts them down before they can solve captchas on your site.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is the most secure anti-bot software for WordPress -- literally.  This is the only anti-bot software that commercial CAPTCHA Solving Sites use for their own defense against bots.  Super CAPTCHA will be the last bot defense software suite you'll ever need assuming your server and WordPress install is compatible.<\/p>\n\n<p>We stand behind our software and ask that if you have problems with it, consult our knowledgebase or open a ticket on our site <a href=\"https:\/\/my.goldsboroweb",
