You may find that you need to decrease your Simplepie cache time to make it work:\n    add_filter( 'wp_feed_cache_transient_lifetime', create_function('$a', 'return 600;') );\nreduces the RSS cache to ten minutes, for example. Put that in your bp-custom.php file if you are having problems with the plugin.<\/p>\n\n<p>At the moment, the plugin uses the Author field from the RSS feed to look for a matching author in your WP database. If it doesn't find one, it uses the unlinked text 'A user', as in 'A user edited the wiki page...'.<\/p>",
