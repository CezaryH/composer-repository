The store url's will also be listed so that your readers can go straight to the merchant if they want to take advantage of them.<\/p>\n\n<p>The links to the merchant are direct links, not affiliate links.  You can monetize these links yourself and make some cash when people use the codes, all you need to do is sign up at skimlinks and add their code to your template.<\/p>\n\n<p>We have currently applied to Wordpress to have our plugin hosted on Wordpress.org, please check back soon for the download link.<\/p>",
