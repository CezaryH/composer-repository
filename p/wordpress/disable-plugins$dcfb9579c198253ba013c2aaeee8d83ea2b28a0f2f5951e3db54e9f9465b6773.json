This plugin will allow you \nto create simple rewrite rules to exclude a plugin or plugins from any URI \npattern match. This is a great way to reduce the memory footprint, SQL queries \nrun at page load, load times, and improve site response speed.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is NOT a normal WordPress plugin, but an <em>mu<\/em> (must use) plugin and requires\nspecial installation instructions.
