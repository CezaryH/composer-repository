The Full Text option is preferable in a lot of cases (e.g. for a podcast), but the feed can grow very large.<\/p>\n\n<p>One problem with a large feed is that if can exceed the <a href=\"http:\/\/support.google.com\/feedburner\/bin\/answer.py?hl=en&#38;answer=79009\">Feedburner 512K limit<\/a>. Your feed may be valid when you first set it up, but eventually when your feed gets big enough, Feedburner will stop updating.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin gives you another setting (available on your Settings \/ Reading admin page) which sets how many posts should have Full Text. All posts after that will be shown as Summary. This gives you the best of both options - Full Text for new posts, and Summary for older posts.&#160;<\/p>",
