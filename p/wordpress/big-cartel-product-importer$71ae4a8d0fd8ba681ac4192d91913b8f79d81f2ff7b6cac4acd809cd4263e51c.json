So, that's what I set out to do.  With this plugin, you can finally link your WordPress website and BigCartel stores by importing your products as posts in a Product custom post type.  The importer pulls in the product ID, product price, product description, product URL, product image for each product.  It will also pull in product categories and assign each product to the proper category.<\/p>",
