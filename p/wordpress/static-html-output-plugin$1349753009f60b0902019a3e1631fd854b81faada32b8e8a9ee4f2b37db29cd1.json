You can run your development site on a different domain or offline, and the plugin will change all relevant URLs when you publish your site. It's a simple but powerful plugin, and after hitting the publish button, the plugin will output a ZIP file of your entire site, ready to upload straight to it's new home.<\/p>\n\n<p>An example of a website which has been generated by this plugin and is now running in a static mode can be seen here:<a href=\"http:\/\/leonstafford.com\" title=\"Leon Stafford\">Leon Stafford<\/a>.
