                "description": "<p>The Showtime plugin allows you to easily manage and display a rotating programming schedule. It was originally built for a college radio station, but it could be used for any kind of schedule that repeats weekly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Showtime takes the current time and displays the name of whatever show\/event you've placed in the timeslot. If there's no show\/event, it displays a custom off-air message. You also have the option of displaying the name of the upcoming show\/event.<\/p>\n\nNew in 3.0\n\n<p>This release is a ground-up re-write, so the code is (hopefully) an awful lot better than it was before. The sorting method is better for the days of the week, and the front-end presentation is no longer a horrible, horrible jQuery hack! Everything is more efficient, better-looking, and the shortcode output doesn't sit on top of all the content anymore. Also, there's some snazzy new AJAX-ification stuff going on in the Schedule manager.<\/p>\n\n<p>Current 2.1 users, don't worry; there's a database upgrader",
