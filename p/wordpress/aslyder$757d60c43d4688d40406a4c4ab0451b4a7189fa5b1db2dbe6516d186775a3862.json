A single function brings a robust slideshow application to any theme page.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is not a quick fix plug-n-play slideshow.  It brings the aSlyder engine easily into Wordpress, and offers admin panel configuration, however this plugin was designed for the savvy developer in mind. A skin for the slideshow must be designed and CSS must be applied for the engine to work.  While set up and configuration is so easy its bordering on ridiculous, it still requires some know-how to put into operation.  This was intended to be a tool for the professional developer, rather than a solution for the casual Wordpress webmaster.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fully skinnable with virtually unlimited styling potential.
