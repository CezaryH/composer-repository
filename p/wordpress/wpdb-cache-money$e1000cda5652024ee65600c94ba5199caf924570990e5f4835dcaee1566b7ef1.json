Result sets will be updated as needed on a user by user basis when they do actions that perform update queries.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please note that this is not a full scale page cache, like WP-Cache or WP Super Cache, although this will work just fine in conjunction.  Cache Money is meant for sites with constantly changing content, where a full cache may not be suitable.<\/p>\n\n<p>Tested with Wordpress and Wordpress MU 2.8.0 ~ 3.1 \nRequires PHP 5, like all good PHP apps.<\/p>",
