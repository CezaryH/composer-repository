Today, it's integrated into WordPress via the <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/topquark\">Top Quark<\/a> architecture and forms the basis for a powerful contact management tool.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Newsletter Engine<\/h4>\n\n<p>As a newsletter engine, poMMo offers the following useful features:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Throttling<\/em> - most web hosts only allow limited amount of emails to be sent per hour.  Find out what your web host allows and then set the throttle in poMMo<\/li>\n<li><em>Templating<\/em> - save your newsletter as a template, or just save it as a draft to return to later<\/li>\n<li><em>Personlization<\/em> - include the recipient's first name, or anything else you track<\/li>\n<li><em>Groups<",
