As well as display images along with titles and short captionsl links can be also added.<\/p>\n\n<p>Images are added to the galleries by uploading via the WordPress Media Gallery and attaching them to the post or page on which they will be displayed. The MovingBoxes gallery can be configured to customise the starting panel, gallery width, panel width, reduced size, fixed height, speed, use of hash tags, wrapping the slider animation, controlling navigation and the animation easing.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Moving Boxes jQuery code was originally written by Chris Coyier (css-tricks.com) and is currently being updated and maintained by Mottie. It is available from GitHub here: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/chriscoyier\/MovingBoxes\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/github.com\/chriscoyier\/MovingBoxes<\/a>.
