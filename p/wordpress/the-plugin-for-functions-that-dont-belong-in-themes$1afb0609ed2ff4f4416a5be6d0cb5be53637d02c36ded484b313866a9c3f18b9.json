This plugin moves that functionality into a plugin, where it is portable, should you change your theme.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is still very much <strong>in beta and in development<\/strong>, but I'm looking for input from you as well. <strong>What functions have you seen in themes that don't belong there?<\/strong> Please tell me so that I can include them in future versions of this plugin.
