Chat rooms are created via the WordPress administrative interface. After creation, users can access it via the permalink for the chat room.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin currently will only support servers that have direct PHP filesystem access, which may not be available on all hosting environments.<\/p>\n\n<p>All official development on this plugin is on GitHub. Version bumps will still be published here on WordPress.org. You can find the repo at <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/WebDevStudios\/Chat-Room\">https:\/\/github.com\/WebDevStudios\/Chat-Room<\/a>. Please file issues, bugs, and enhancement ideas there, when possible.<\/p>",
