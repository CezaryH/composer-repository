                "description": "<p>There are plenty of occasions where I'd love to use a plugin from another developer, but I need to disable links that the plugin creates. For instance, Genesis Responsive Slider is awesome, but sometimes I don't want the links to be active. I just want to show the slider content. LinkBuster will allow you to specify a CSS Path (a div class or ID, etc) and will replace all the hrefs with # so they links are effectively disabled.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin creates a widget. That widget can be placed in any widget area. Multiple LinkBuster widgets can be used to disable links in separate CSS paths.<\/p>",
