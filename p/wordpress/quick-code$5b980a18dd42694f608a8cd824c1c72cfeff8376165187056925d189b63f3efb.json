There has been many times that I needed to test bits of code to see exactly what the output would be. For instance, whilst developing a WordPress Plugin, you may need to know what a certain database call will return, or want to know the effect of using a PHP or WordPress function, constant, or object. Simply enter in the required code and the output is displayed!<\/p>\n\n<p>Usually this meant I had to set-up test 'echo' statements and risk this being visible on the main site pages by visitors (which is undersirable on a live site). Now there is a way to quickly test code which is only displayed in the admin area of your blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>This Plugin can also be used as a simple WYSIWYG HTML\/CSS editor, the results of the code are displayed directly above the code input box.<\/p>\n\n<p>But, that is not all!
