Protein folding is the root cause of many health problems, and with the information gathered from running the simulations, scientists at Stanford University better understand why proteins misfold and how to fix them.<br \/>\nThis project is a noble cause and doesn't require any monetary contribution, just your free CPU cycles.  Your PC can provide for the advancement of everyone and possibly lead to the cure for some diseases.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please join the cause and feel free to fold under our team, or create your own!
