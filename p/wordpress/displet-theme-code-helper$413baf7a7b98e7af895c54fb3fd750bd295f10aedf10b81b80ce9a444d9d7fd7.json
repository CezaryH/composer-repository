This plugin removes the faulty code that was unwisely suggested in a blog that unfortunately has been implemented by not-so-great theme developers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Read more about the bad practice and its origins: <a href=\"http:\/\/theandystratton.com\/2011\/shortcode-autoformatting-html-with-paragraphs-and-line-breaks\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/theandystratton.com\/2011\/shortcode-autoformatting-html-with-paragraphs-and-line-breaks<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Most of all, don't purchase a theme from ThemeForest - they're aware of the bad practice and have done nothing to proactively remove the faulty themes from their website. They say they're on the way to better quality control practices - well that starts with taking down the themes that utilize bad practices and they're not willing to even do that. Ug",
