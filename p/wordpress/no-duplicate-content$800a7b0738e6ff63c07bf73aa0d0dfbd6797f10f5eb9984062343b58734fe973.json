No Duplicate Content is brought to you by Chung Bey Luen.&#60;br\/&#62;\n&#60;br\/&#62;\nGoogle, together with Yahoo and Microsoft have just announced a new tag, canonical link, which can be used to publicly tell search engines your preferred version of a URL. If your site has identical or vastly similar content that's accessible through multiple URLs, canonical link provides you with more control over the URL returned in search results. It also helps to make sure that the properties of a web page such as link popularity are consolidated to your preferred URL.&#60;br\/&#62;\n&#60;br\/&#62;\nCheck out my blog post about the <a href=\"\">duplicate content issue<\/a>.&#60;br\/&#62;\n&#60;br\/&#62;\nPlugin Homepage: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloghighlight.com\/wordpress-plugins\/no-duplicate-content\/\">No Duplicate Content<\/a>&#60;br\/&#62;<\/p>",
