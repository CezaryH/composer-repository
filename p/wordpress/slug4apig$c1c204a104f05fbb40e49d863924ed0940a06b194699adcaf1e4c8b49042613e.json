As easy as you edit\nthe name, description, etc. for each image, with Slug4apig you will be able to edit the friendly URL (aka slug)\nand set the desired value.<\/p>\n\n<p>By default, the WordPress built-in gallery will set the attachment post's slug to the name of the image you inserted in\nthe gallery (minus .extension). This is a rather restrictive approach, as your images may have sequencial names\nassigned automatically by the photo camera, like \"S4100001.JPG\".<\/p>\n\n<p>In the previous example, an autocreated attachment post would be created under the hypothetical URL:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code><a href=\"http:\/\/example.com\/2011\/03\/post-title\/S4100001\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/example.com\/2011\/03\/post-title\/S4100001\/<\/a>\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p",
