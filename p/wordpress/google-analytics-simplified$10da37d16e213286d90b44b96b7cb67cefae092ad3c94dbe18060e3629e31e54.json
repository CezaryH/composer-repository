Which means that when you're previewing a post, the snippet will not be displayed and your page views will not be tracked.<\/p>\n\n<p>The main repository for Google Analytics simplified is hosted over at <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/raatiniemi\/google-analytics-simplified\/\">GitHub<\/a>. Feel free to submit pull requests, or requests features or bugs in the issue tracker.<\/p>",
