It uses \nthe Last.fm API via AJAX to fetch the data and includes a functional (albeit crude) caching mechanism to improve \nperformance. You can make sure Last.fm gets updated with music played from different sources by utilizing one of the many \nscrobbler plugins available. For example, I use Rhapsody for music streaming, and therefore decided to use Rhobbler \nto make sure that Last.fm has a complete profile on my listening habits.
