With the help of an API written by words.bighugelabs.com, this is that tool.<\/p>\n\n<p>Very simple AJAX based interface, which allows for thesaurus lookups without leaving the page, so you can lookup a word before you lose the thought.<\/p>\n\n<p>Designed for use in the sidebar, but could probably work anywhere.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basic result limiting functionality is included, so you can return a maximum of N results.<\/p>",
