You can also manage unique excerpts\/descriptions for each product.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plug-in is also compatible with Cart66 should you wish to add the ability to purchase products. Also compatible with other plug-ins such as NextGEN Gallery.<\/p>\n\n<p>We created this plugin to display items on a clients website and have even used it ourself to display printing products such as flyers, brochures, postcards, business cards etc. We decided to share it with the world :-)<\/p>",
