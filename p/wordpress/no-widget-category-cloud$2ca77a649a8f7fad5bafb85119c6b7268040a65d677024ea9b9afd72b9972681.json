I found that there were multiple plugin widgets available, but no plugin that would allow me to just place a php function into my theme to display a category cloud.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some ideas for oter uses of this plugin:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Install WP-Sticky and Exec-PHP.  Create a Sticky post which will stay at the top of your page and type the php code for this plugin in the post.  Now you have a Category Cloud that stays at the top of your page.<\/li>\n<\/ol>",
