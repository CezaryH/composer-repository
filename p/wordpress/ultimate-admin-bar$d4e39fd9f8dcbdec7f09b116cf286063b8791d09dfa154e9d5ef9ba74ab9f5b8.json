Now you can have one menu bar that does pretty much everything you could ever need. This plugin adds the admin menu (the menu on the left side of the screen) to the admin bar. The admin menu is 'fixed', like the admin bar so that it will appear no matter how far you have scrolled down, keeping it easily accessible and consistently in the same spot. The screen options and help menus however do not, so keep that in mind.<\/p>",
