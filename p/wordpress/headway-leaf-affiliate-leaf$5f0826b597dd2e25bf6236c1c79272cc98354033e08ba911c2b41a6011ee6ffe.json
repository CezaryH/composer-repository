                "description": "<p>We wanted an easier way for our affiliates to display a box on their site. This leaf enables you to do that. Add the leaf wherever you want, however we think it&#8217;s best on the Single Post page in between two content leafs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve added the leaf just select one of the styles or add a custom CSS class and take over full design control.<\/p>\n\n<p>This leaf will display a clickable image and two links in the text. It takes the affiliate link you&#8217;ve setup in Headway&#8217;s configuration and uses that link for all three links.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin requires <a href=\"http:\/\/headwaythemes.com\">Headway Themes<\/a> to be installed and activated for it to work.<\/p>",
