Without any capability to change the string, one must provide the hint in another post, which is a bit clumsy. Not to mention, people viewing the single protected post only will be unable to see the hint at all. With this plugin protected posts are more usable.<\/p>\n\n<p>The password hint is taken from a certain custom field within the protected post, with key name &#8216;password_hint&#8217;. If this key is present, the value of key is immediately taken as the password hint. Without the key, the standard password form is shown again.<\/p>",
