If more than a certain amount of headings (3 by default) are found - a table of contents with bookmarks is formed and inserted to the post content. Location (above or below) the text can be chosen in settings page.<\/p>\n\n<p>TOC is formed as HTML5 <code>&#60;nav&#62;<\/code> element with nested ordered list inside. No specific styling is provided, so that it fits organicaly into the text. If you need specific styling, include it to your theme's CSS.<\/p>",
