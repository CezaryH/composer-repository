There is a public git repo here <a href=\"https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/ChaosKiller\/cookie-consent-wp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/ChaosKiller\/cookie-consent-wp<\/a> so please try to work with my to find the problem<\/p>\n\n<p>Dutch law states that before a cookie is even placed on someone\u0092s computer, you need their consent. The problem is that other EU countries only require you to notify them and remove the cookies if the user disagrees. The big difference is when the cookie may be placed.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin will show a warning to the user that this site uses cookies. If the user clicks \"yes\" a cookie will be placed that he agrees. If not, he\/she can't \nbrowse the site.<\/p>",
