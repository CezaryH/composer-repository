For the above example, there would be Custom Fields on the home page called \"company_name\" and \"email\" with the values, respectively, of \"Example Company Name\" and \"info@example.com\".<\/p>\n\n<p><em>This plugin requires that you have WordPress set to show a static Page on the home page under Settings-&#62;Reading and \"Front page\".<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>So then, for all the custom fields entered on the home page, this plugin looks for shortcodes (in all pages) and replaces each of their values, upon output, with the relevant custom field value.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is useful for if you want to fill many pages w",
