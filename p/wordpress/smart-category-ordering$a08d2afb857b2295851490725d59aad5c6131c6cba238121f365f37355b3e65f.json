You can apply your sorting to a single category, or have your settings follow a category tree, covering the parent and children categories.<\/p>\n\n<p>When sorting by \"Smart Title\", that option is there to the leading 'a', 'an' or 'the' from a post title when sorting.  This is the only difference between \"Smart Title\" and \"Title.\"<\/p>",
