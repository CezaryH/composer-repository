And the URL is displayed below the blog post. If the permalink of the article changes, a new Short URL will be automatically generated.\nThese Short URLs are particular useful for twitter and alike as these services limit the messages of their users to a certain amount of characters - which leads to the situation that their users are forced to have an eye on what exactly they want to write.\nAnd by providing a very short URL it's easier for them to spread the word on your blog article as they have more characters left for personal remarks.  Of course this will help promote your blog.<\/p>",
