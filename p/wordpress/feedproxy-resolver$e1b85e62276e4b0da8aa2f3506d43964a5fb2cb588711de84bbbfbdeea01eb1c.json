Unfortunately some blogger use it\n(their choise), so linking to their posts requires work to 'free' the links.\nStupid task (copy to browser, copy new url), that can get scripted very easy.<\/p>\n\n<p>FeedproxyResolver tries to do this, by looking over new posts (by a regex), do a curl\nrequest for every found feedproxy link and replace the link with the 'correct'\none (http header redirect_url).<\/p>",
