Of these, \"install\" is of course the most interesting; \"try again\" could be an aborted install attempt, or impatient users; with \"upgrade\" the user already has an older version of your app installed; and with \"launch\", the app is already up-to-date and installed - this is usually yourself clicking to see if it works :-)<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: works with a customized Adobe AIR badge, jQuery, and an older version of swfObject (1.5).<\/p>\n\n<p>To make it work, you need to add an External Interface call to your AIR Badge.
