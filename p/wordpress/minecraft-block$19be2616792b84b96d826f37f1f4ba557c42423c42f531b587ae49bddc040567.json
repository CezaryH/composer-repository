Amazing!<\/p>\n\n<p>For browsers which support it, you will be able to add a CSS3 3D rotating Minecraft block of your choice anywhere on \nyour site. For browsers that do not support the full 3D CSS3 transforms, it will fall back to an isometric cube. Finally, \non browsers that do not support CSS transforms at all, it will fall back to a flat Minecraft block, showing your support \nfor Minecraft in more of a flat nature.
