You can't test them before they go live; they'll play havoc\nwith your version control system, if you're using one; and if they fail\nor screw up, your live site is broken. Bad. Idea.<\/p>\n\n<p>Enter Staunch. Staunch makes you stick to best practice for upgrades, by\npreventing even admins and superadmins from running WordPress's\nautomatic upgrade processes on your live site.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you want to upgrade WordPress, you can do so on a local or\ndevelopment install of your site; after you've tested it and made sure\neverything's okay, you can then deploy the site as you usually would\n&#8212; through version control, FTP, or something else.<\/p>",
