                "description": "<p>This Plugin is extended version of \"Latest Posts by Author\" Wordpress plugin. This plugin allows you to display an unordered list of links to a specific author's latest posts (or a list of multiple authors). It can be called either with a shortcode or from within a theme file.<\/p>\n\n<p>To call it with a shortcode, use <code>[latestbyauthor author=\"username\" show=\"3\"]<\/code> where \"username\" is the login name of the author (or a comma separated list of multiple authors) and \"3\" is the number of posts to display. If you don't specify an author or a display number, it will show the latest 5 posts from the author of the current page. If you want it to display the post excerpt as well, you can use the following code: <code>[latestbyauthor author=\"username\" show=\"3\" excerpt=\"true\"]<\/code> This will only show exerpts that you have entered manually.<\/p>\n\n<p>To call it from within a theme template, you have to wrap it in this PHP function: <code>&#60;?php echo do_shortcode('[latestbyauthor au",
                "uid": "17139"
            }
        }
    }
