Also, automatically logs in the new user since the account is already active.<\/p>\n\n<p>THIS IS BETA , please test it carefully as this plugin was created for a client and i haven't tested it deeply. So again, test this on a production site before making it live<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically i updated the plugin and added some features like:<\/p>\n\n<p>-Option to turn off automatic login\n-Redirect options after account creation<\/p>\n\n<p>Known Bugs:\n-Doesn't do the automatic login if you allow blog creation during the user creation in WPMU (multisite)<\/p>",
