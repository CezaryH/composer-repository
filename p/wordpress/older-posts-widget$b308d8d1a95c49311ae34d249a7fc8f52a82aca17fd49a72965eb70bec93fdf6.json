Let&apos;s say the front page shows 10 latest posts. However, if you wish to display few older posts in the widget area starting from the 11th latest post, then this widget is of use to you. Define the x-th recent post from which the widget need to display and how many posts to display and the widget will elegantly do just that :)\nFor more information visit the plugin page at <a href=\"http:\/\/techallica.com\/wordpress-older-posts-widget\" title=\"techallica\">Techallica<\/a><\/p>",
