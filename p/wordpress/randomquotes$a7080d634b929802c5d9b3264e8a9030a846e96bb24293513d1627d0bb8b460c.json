I made it as simple as I could so that very little programming knowledge is needed to make it work. You only need to put one short line of code into your Wordpress page.  You will need to put some quotes into a simple text file.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want a simple first plugin for making customizations to your blog, this would be a good one to start with.<\/p>",
