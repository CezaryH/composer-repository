                "description": "<p>MondoKode-Zoomer was created for blogs that have a narrow reading column but will\nbe embedding code using the wp_syntax plugin.  A narrow column is a pleasure to read\nand there is a reason for this.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"That's why newspapers have narrow columns: It makes them faster to read.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Amar Sagoo <a href=\"http:\/\/amarsagoo.info\/tofu\/\">Tofu web page<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>However, it is a nuissance to have a narrow width constraint when presenting kode.  I've caught myself \nreformatting kode on numerous occasions in hope of eliminating the horizontal scrollbar.\nWith this plugin you can spend more time sharing kode and less time formatting it for a skinny column.<\/p>",
