Your blog becomes more than Social Friendly, it's now in the Facebook Open Graph.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you fully use the sharing buttons, SoShake allows you to add new features that we developed: Social buttons will not be only about sharing anymore.\nYou'll be able to show more content after sharing, propose a visitor to like your Facebook page or your Twitter accourt, to subscribe to your RSS feed, to watch your last video&#8230;\nJust go to <a href=\"http:\/\/soshake.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/soshake.com<\/a> to create an account and you will be able to create some awesome post-share action.\n** A SoShake account is not required to insert the share buttons",
