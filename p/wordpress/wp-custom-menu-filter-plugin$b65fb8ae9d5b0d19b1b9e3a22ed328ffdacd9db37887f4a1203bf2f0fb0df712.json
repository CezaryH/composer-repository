Instead of using the generic CSS {display:none;}, this plugin actually excludes nav menu items from even being created.

Instead using one custom menu, the user can hide portions of their custom menu to visitors (even the savvy ones) while revealing other portions of their menu to users who are logged in and vice versa.<\/p>",
