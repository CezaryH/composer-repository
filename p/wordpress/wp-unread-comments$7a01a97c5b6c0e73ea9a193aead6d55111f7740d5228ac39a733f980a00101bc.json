This is useful when you have an active comments section on a blog and want users to be able to find the newest comments easily.  This is analagous to View Unread Posts on a phpbb forum.  If logged in, the user will be able to click on the title of the post in the widget to find the oldest of the unread comments in the list.<\/p>\n\n<p>I created this plug-in to fill a need that I had for my readers on a more active blog.  Most of these readers are used to reading forums where they can easily find a list of all the threads that have new comments and by clicking an icon, be taken directly to the oldest new comment in their list.  I was unable to find any plug-ins in Wordpress to do something like this so I decided to write this on",
