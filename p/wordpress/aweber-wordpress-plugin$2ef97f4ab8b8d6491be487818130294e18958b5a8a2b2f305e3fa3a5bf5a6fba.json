This powerful plugin will help you build your subscriber list.<\/p>\n\n<p>The dashboard option page allows you to configure the plugin to display a checkbox with agreement text should you wish to ask for your visitors to first agree to be opt-in. You may also turn this feature off so that everyone who registers and\/or makes a comment on your blog gets automatically subscribed to your list.<\/p>\n\n<p>You will not find this plugin anywhere on the internet right now because it was never made available until now. We have used this plugin to explode our Aweber lists - think about all those commenters on your blog, they are forever lost if you don't get them on your list!<\/p>",
