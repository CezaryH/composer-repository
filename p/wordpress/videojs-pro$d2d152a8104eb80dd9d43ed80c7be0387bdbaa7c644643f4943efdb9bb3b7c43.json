                "description": "<p>  VideoJS Pro is a plugin for Wordpress that provides an easy to use interface for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.videojs.com\/\">VideoJS<\/a>, developed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.steveheffernan.com\/\">Steve Heffernan<\/a>.<br \/>\n  VideoJS is an HTML5 Video Player with 3 core parts: An embed code (<a href=\"http:\/\/camendesign.com\/code\/video_for_everybody\">Video for Everybody<\/a>), a Javascript library (video.js), and a pure HTML\/CSS skin (video-js.css).<br \/>\n  Using Video for Everybody as the embed code means you know it&#8217;s compatible with many devices (including ones without javascript).  The javascript library fixes browser &#38; device bugs, and makes sure your video is even more compatible across different browser versions.<br \/>\n  The pure HTML5\/CSS skin ensures a consistent look between HTML5 browsers, and easy custom skinning if you want to give it a specific look, or brand it with your own colors. See the skins page for examples of custom skins.<br \/>\nPlease visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vide",
