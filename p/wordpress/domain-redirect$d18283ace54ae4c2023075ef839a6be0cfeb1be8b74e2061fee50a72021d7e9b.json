My band's name (Harmony Glen) ends with one N, while many people type it with two (Harmony Glenn). I registered that faulty domain and made sure that when someone entered the wrong name, they got redirected to the right domain and a page that explains how to spell the name correctly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Perhaps this plugin is of some use for you. I intend to add the option to enter more domain names, currently it supports only one redirect.<\/p>",
