Timeline events can be filtered by taxonomy terms and post types, including custom taxonomies and post types enabled by your active theme.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to Wordpress content, you can also add content to the timeline from Twitter - filtering by multiple hashtags.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can set timeline events to be \"featured\", ie: span across both columns to be more prominent by setting a custom meta field key to mf_timeline_featured and its value to 1. This is great for indicating milestones on the timeline, or highlighting a particular piece of information on the timeline.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please report all issues or give feedback on the plugin's <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/matt-d-rat\/MF-Timeline\" title=\"MF Timeline Repository\">Github repository<\/a>.<\/p>",
