                "description": "<p>This is just a fun little plugin that datamines keywords.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ideal for people that struggle to think out-of-the-box for new niche ideas to build web sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>It uses 2 sources at the moment.<\/p>\n\n<p>Source number 1 is Froogle (Google shopping site). The keywords come from actual searches that users on Froogle are entering.<\/p>\n\n<p>Source number 2 is Google Suggest. Here you can enter keywords, or partial keywords, and you will get a list of the most searched for terms, as well as an estimate of the number of competing pages on Google for each keyword. Handy for some slightly more detailed keyword research. What you are ideally looking for is heavily searched for keywords, that have less competing pages.<\/p>\n\n<p>See also: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.psp-tubes.net\/wordpress\/\">More Handy Plugins for eBay (EPN) and phpBay<\/a>.<\/p>",
