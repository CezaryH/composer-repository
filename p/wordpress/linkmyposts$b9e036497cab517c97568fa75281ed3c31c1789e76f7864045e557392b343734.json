Creating links from post to post, page by page can be cumbersome and readers navigating to these related posts can sometimes be difficult to understand. With LinkMyPosts, you (the Wordpress Author) can link all of your related posts into one \u0093book\u0094 and display a friendly link list to your users while they are reading a post. This link list will intuitively allow them to navigate to the next or previous page, as well as jump to the beginning or the end.<\/p>",
