And that means more referral fees in your pocket!<\/p>\n\n<p>The basic problem is that if the visitor clicks the associate link in the post, likes the product but orders it from another Amazon site, the associate won't get the referral fee. So it is beneficial to direct the visitor to the Amazon site that he would most likely buy from.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you have for example created a link to Amazon.com in your post and you have a visitor from Europe, the plugin will change the Amazon.com link to Amazon.co.uk or some other European site (de, fr). The plugin supports directing visitor's to Amazon com, ca, fr, de, co.uk and jp. There are 234 countries in the plugin's database and you can choose which Amazon store is shown to a visitor from each of those countries.<\/p>",
