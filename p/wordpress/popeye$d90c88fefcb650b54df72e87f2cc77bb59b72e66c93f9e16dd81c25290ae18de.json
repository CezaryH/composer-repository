Use it to save space when displaying a collection of images and offer your users a simple way to show a big version of your images without leaving the page flow.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is based on Christoph Schuessler's jQuery.popeye which was designed as an alternative to the often-seen JavaScript image lightbox (see Lightbox 2, Fancybox or Colorbox, just to name a few). In contrast to them it does not employ a modal window to display the large images, thus disrupting the workflow of the user interacting with a webpage, but takes a different approach: not only allows it for browsing all thumbnails as well as the large images in a single image space, it also repects the page flow and stays anchored and rooted in the webpage at all times, thus giving a less disruptive user experience than modal windows.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin is very easy to set up and integrates automatically into your pos",
