At the same time the UK updated its Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, which brought the EU Directive it into UK law.<\/p>\n\n<p>Each EU member state has done or is doing the same thing. Although they all have their own approach and interpretation, the basic requirements of the directive remain the same.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plug-in will create a small banner at the top of the guest's browser that greets them with the message:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>W",
