Tasks operate on the backend but plan to operate on the frontend as well as offer more interoperability with 3rd party plugins.  Users click on a task link and are given instructions as well as highlighting specific to those instructions.  After completing a task, users are given further links and information to learn from.  Users may at any time skip tasks, allowing them to learn what is most convenient\/relevant to their needs.<\/p>",
