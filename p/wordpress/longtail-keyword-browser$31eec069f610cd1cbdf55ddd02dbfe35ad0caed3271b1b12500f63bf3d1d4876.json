The plugin will return a navigation tree \nsimilar to folders on your computer.  Open a folder and the tool will find longer keywords. \nI use this as a Google wonder wheel alternative.<\/p>\n\n<p>PLEASE keep in mind this is meant to be a very simple plugin. If you rate this plugin \nless than 5, please tell me why in the forums so I can either help you with an issue and\/or improve the \nplugin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently only supports US and UK English.<\/p>",
