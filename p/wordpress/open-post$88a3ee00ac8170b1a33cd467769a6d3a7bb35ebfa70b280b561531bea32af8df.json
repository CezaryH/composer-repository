However, sometimes these owners might want to allow anonymous users to post comments on selected posts and pages. This is where the simple and basic Open Post plugin comes into play. On a website or blog where comments can only be posted by registered users, you can use this plugin to override this on posts and pages of your choice.<\/p>\n\n<p>Check out some of the other <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spunkyjones.com\/\">WordPress plugins<\/a> by the same author.<\/p>",
