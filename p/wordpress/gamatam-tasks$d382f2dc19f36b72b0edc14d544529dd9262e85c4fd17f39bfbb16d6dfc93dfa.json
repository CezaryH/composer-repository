It is not as comprehensive as most issue trackers (no work flow etc) by design, I found a lot of clients looking for something more useful than a spreadsheet or todo list, but not as complicated to use as bugzilla, trac et al.<\/p>\n\n<p>I've also streamlined the main user interface ('Current Tasks' in the admin section) to use AJAX to update the tasks. I've really minimized the amount of 'noise' a user would normally be subjected to, so some 'power users' might not approve.<\/p>\n\n<p>Gamatam Tasks has the following features:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Uses Wordpress Users<\/li>\n<li>Status can be 'open', 'in progress', 'testing', 'closed' and 'deleted'<\/li>\n<li>Priority can be 'high', medium, 'low'<\/li>\n<li>Tasks with 'deleted' status are not removed from the database, put can be removed permanently<\/li>\n<li>Two main views of ta",
