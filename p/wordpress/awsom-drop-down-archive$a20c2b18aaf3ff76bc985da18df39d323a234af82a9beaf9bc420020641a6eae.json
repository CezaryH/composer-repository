                "description": "<p>The AWSOM Archive (formerly called AWSOM Drop Down Archive) is a plugin designed to add a Drop Down or other type of archive selector on your Index and individual Posts pages. This plugin by default requires no theme editing to work and appears right after activating your plugin. It makes it easy for your readers to immediately select a new post to view. This is especially good for Webcomic or Art sites and replicates the archive that is on the Megatokyo.com website. If you want a more customized archive you may enter custom options for CSS, name, archive parameters, and add custom locations all from the admin options area. The newest version of the plugin now allows you to place the archive in a post or page by using the code %%awsomarchive%%, so now you can place the archive anywhere you want. Plugin Now Features Full XHTML compliance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.AWSOM.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.AWSOM.org<\/a> series of Wordpress Plugins developed by Harknell, webma",
