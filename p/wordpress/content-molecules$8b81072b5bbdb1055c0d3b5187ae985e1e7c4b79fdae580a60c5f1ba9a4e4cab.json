Taking the concept a little further, any number of custom attributes can be added to the usage of the shortcode, and those values can be embedded in the resulting output.<\/p>\n\n<p>[m id=\"slug\" audience=\"Student\" product=\"backpack\"]<\/p>\n\n<p>Will translate the following molecule:<\/p>\n\n<p>Greetings {audience}!\nCheck out our new {product} today!<\/p>\n\n<p>into this:<\/p>\n\n<p>Greetings Student!\nCheck out our new backpack today!<\/p>\n\n<p>Obviously a ridiculous example, but the flexibility remains the same regardless of the silly intent.
