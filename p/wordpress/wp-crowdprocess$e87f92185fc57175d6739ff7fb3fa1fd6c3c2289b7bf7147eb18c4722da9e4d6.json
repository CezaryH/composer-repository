It then purchase that processing power from websites, turns it into a single supercomputer and makes it available to people who are solving computationally heavy problems such as credit attribution, transport grid optimization or even genome sequencing.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin allows you to specify an API Key that will be used by a \"worker\" on your website. Note that you need to have an active CrowdProcess account to generate this key.<\/p>",
