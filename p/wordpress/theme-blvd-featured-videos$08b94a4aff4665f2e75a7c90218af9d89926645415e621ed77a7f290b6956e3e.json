This option will allow you to switch out the featured image on the particular post you're editing with a video. You can then insert a video URL compatible with WordPress's built-in oEmbed features.<\/p>\n\n<p>This video will then get inserted where you would normally see a featured image for that post wherever it's set to show such as post lists, post grids, single posts, etc. And because you're working with a Theme Blvd theme, this video will also, of course, be respsonsive with the rest of the theme.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Why would I use this plugin?<\/h4>\n\n<p>This would be a cool plugin for anyone that likes posting a lot of videos.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you're someone who posts",
