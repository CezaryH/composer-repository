If so, SponsorMe can help you run your campaign directly from your blog. It allows you to show people what your target is, how much you have saved and how much is outstanding. And if they decide to contribute, SponsorMe will collect details of their pledge and allow them to make a PayPal payment straight into your account.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin includes an administration interface where you can see your pledges, verify them once you receive the funds or delete them if they prove to be void. It also allows you to change the colours of your graph as well as all the details about what you are looking for sponsorship for.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>New Feature<\/strong> You can now accept pledges from users who do not have PayPal.
