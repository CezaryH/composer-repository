This plugin will take care of that for you.<\/p>\n\n<p>It uses .htaccess file modifications to deny access to your blog from particular IP addresses (Deny from) and then follows up with an ErrorDocument 403 redirect to a URL of your choice. It doesn't hook into Wordpress, which makes it a lot faster due to no database or PHP calls.<\/p>",
