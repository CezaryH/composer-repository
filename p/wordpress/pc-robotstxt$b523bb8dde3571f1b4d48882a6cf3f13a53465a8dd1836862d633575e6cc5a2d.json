Instead of mucking about with FTP, files, permissions ..etc, just upload and activate the plugin and you're done.<\/p>\n\n<p>By default, the PC Robots.txt plugin has a bunch of spam-bots disallowed, the Google bots specifically allowed, and a few of the standard WordPress folders and files disallowed. If you want to change what appears in your robots.txt file, you can easily edit the contents from the plugin settings page under Settings, PC Robots.txt in your blog administration.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the plugin detects an existing XML sitemap file, a reference to it will be automatically added to your robots.txt file.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information, to offer feedback, to ask questions or to submit bugs please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/petercoughlin.com\/robotstxt-wordpress-plugin\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/petercoughlin.com\/robotstxt-wordpress-plugin\/<\/a><\/p>",
