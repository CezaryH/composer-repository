Ordinarily, if a user types something like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.google.com\/<\/a>, it\nwill automatically be turned into a clickable link when it is displayed.  This\nplugin disables this behavior for http, ftp, and e-mail links.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that comments can include the HTML tags necessary to create links, if you\nallow HTML in comments, and these links will not be removed.  This also allows\nyou as the administrator to get around the \"no comments in links\" rule enforced\nby this plugin, since administrators (and editors) by default can post comments\nwith unfiltered HTML.<\/p>",
