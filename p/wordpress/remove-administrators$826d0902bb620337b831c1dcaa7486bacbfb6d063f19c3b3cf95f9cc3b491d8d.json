Maybe even a custom role? What if you wanted to hide the Admin user(s) from them altogether? This plugin does exactly that!<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently based off the 'update_core' permission, Remove Administrators hides all references to Admins from all other user roles on the dashboard. The next release will support configurable permissions and multisite installations.<\/p>",
