Dozens more are available in other languages including Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Portugese, Russian, and German. Original languages (Greek and Hebrew) are also available.

A special API service sends you only the text you need, so you don't have to store the whole Bible on your own site.<\/p>\n\n<p>The bible text is added by your server, not by Javascript. This means the text can be even seen by those who don't have javascri",
