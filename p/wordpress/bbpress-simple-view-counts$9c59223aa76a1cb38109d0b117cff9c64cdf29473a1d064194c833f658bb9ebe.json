The plugin inserts the count into two places, \nonce on the forum listing page and once at the top of each post.<\/p>\n\n<p>The count is currently incremented on each refresh of the page.  Counts are recorded using the WordPress post meta API.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that this is a new plugin and has not been tested on high volume sites so please perform your own tests\nbefore implementing.  Feedback on performance greatly appreciated.  Please post in the plugin's WP forum area or \nmention @jezza101 in a tweet.<\/p>",
