It's what I've used on Zeaks.org for a while, and highly based off of Danny Van Kooten's Simple Quote Code Snippets plugin. It's lightweight, uses no JavaScript, comes with 4 editable color schemes and very easy to use.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong> Does not highlight code, simply displays it in a nice way and allows posting of any code.<\/p>\n\n<p>Use [code] Your Code [\/code] in any post.<\/p>",
