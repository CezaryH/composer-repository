As an example you could call them Car Dealership and Cars and assign a bunch of cars to a dealership.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is an example template file included which displays the parent post as well as a list of all the children posts assigned to it.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's really more of a starting point but it does work.<\/p>\n\n<p>Requires WordPress 3.0 and PHP 5.<\/p>",
