This plugin solves the problem by placing a link below the excerpt which will either expand the text with AJAX (if a wire comment) or open a new window with the direct link (e.g. blog posts and comments).<\/p>\n\n<p>If you have any problems with the plugins, please visit our <a href=\"http:\/\/netweblogic.com\/forums\/\">support forums<\/a> for further information and provide some feedback first, we may be able to help. It's considered rude to just give low ratings and no reason for doing so.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you find this plugin useful and would like to say thanks, a link, digg, or some other form of recognition to the plugin page on our blog would be appreciated.<\/p>",
