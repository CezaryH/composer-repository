The plugin supports multiple coaches, staffs, and teams. It provides several views of staffs including coaches table (screenshot-1), a coaches gallery (screenshot-2), and single coach profiles (screenshot-3). Samples of all of the above displays are available on the <a href=\"http:\/\/shoalsummitsolutions.com\/dev\">Shoal Summit Solutions Plugin Development Site<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is designed to handle some challenges unique to high school coaching staffs, where coaches often coach two (or more) teams in different roles. For example, one coach can be the Head Coach of the Junior Varsity team and the Offensive Line coach for the Varsity team. That coach can be shown as the first coach on the JV staff and somewhere lower on the Varsity staff listings. Here's how to do it:<\/p>\n\n<o",
