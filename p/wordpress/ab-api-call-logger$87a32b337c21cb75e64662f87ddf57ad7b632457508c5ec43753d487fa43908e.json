Of course, if you prefer, you can instantiate your own object using the <code>AB_API_Logger<\/code> class.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <code>log_api_call()<\/code> method takes two properties. The first is an array of URLs that will be included as menu items (easy access, easy click to see responses). By default, the plugin maintains a property <code>$api_calls<\/code> with this array and uses it to  parse out the menu items.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, if you wish to maintain your own array, you can do that too. The plugin takes care of what it needs, and you can feel free to maintain what you need.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second argument for the <code>log_api_calls()<\/code> method is t",
