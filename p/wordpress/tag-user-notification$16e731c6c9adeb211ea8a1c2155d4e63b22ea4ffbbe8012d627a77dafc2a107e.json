I work with an art collective and we're all posting multiple posts on multiple topics and as we've tried to shift more and more of our conversations out of email and onto our website, there didn't seem to be an easy way to bring specific people into these comment conversations without using a more general comment notification plugin. Notify Tagged User attempts to change that.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin would help out any multi author blogs, and in particular, teams or project blogs that focus on internal communication.<\/p>\n\n<p>Basically the plugin works by using the familiar Twitter @user reply syntax in the following way:\n-check all new comments for the @user syntax\n-if tagged users are found, look through the database for registered users' nicknames matching the tagged user\n-if a registered user's nickname is found, get the associated email address\n-send an email to all u",
