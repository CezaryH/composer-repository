The original concept is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rsc-ne-scotland.org.uk\/mashe\/2010\/06\/convergence-youtube-meets-twitter-in-timeline-commenting-of-youtube-videos-using-twitter-utitle\/\">explained in detail in this blog post<\/a>, but the basic idea is video are played in custom interface which lets users 'tweet' comments. Part of each tweet includes a hashtag linking it to a specific YouTube video and a timestamp from the current point in the video. Tweets are stored in the <a href=\"http:\/\/twapperkeeper.com\/\">TwapperKeepr<\/a> and temporarily cached on the uTitle site. When a video is replayed in the uTitle interface existing comments appear at the timed points as subtitles and users can also use the timed tweets to jump to part of the video <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RVp2F6tDWfw\">(see this vide",
