                "description": "<p>The SEO Stoppord Wordpress plugin removes common Swedish words like 'i', 'p&#229;', 'att' from post slugs to improve search engine optimization.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, when you publish a post with a title like this:<\/p>\n\n<p>\"What You Can Do Immediately For Higher Rankings\",<\/p>\n\n<p>Wordpress automatically assigns a long filename to your post, called a post slug:<\/p>\n\n<p>\/what-you-can-do-immediately-for-higher-rankings<\/p>\n\n<p>SEO Stoppord plugin strips common words like \"Att\", \"h&#228;r\" or \"d&#228;r\" out of your post slug to make it more search engine friendly. With SEO Stoppord plugin activated, the slug for our example blog post would look like this:<\/p>\n\n<p>\/immediately-higher-rankings<\/p>\n\n<p>The slug is generated on saving a post (so you get a chance to look at it before publishing, and change it), or on publish. It won't overwrite an existing slug. You can force a new slug generation by deleting the existing one.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is based on SEO Slugs by vretoolbar<\/p>",
