                "description": "<p>I tried two drop-cap plugins available in the worpress community. What I noticed is that both are not supporting characters like Chinese. So I just build one my own. wp-dropcaps makes it easy to change the first letter or character into a drop-cap. \nExample: [dc]T[\/dc]his is my paragraph with a drop cap. The first letter 'T' will turn into a drop cap. And, [dc]\u6d4b[\/dc]\u8bd5\u63d2\u4ef6, the character '\u6d4b' will be drop-capped.\nIf you don't want your article have a drop cap, just leave it the way used to.\nPlugin home page: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.conanblog.me\/it\/program\/drop-caps-plugin-for-wordpress\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.conanblog.me\/it\/program\/drop-caps-plugin-for-wordpress\/<\/a><\/p>",
