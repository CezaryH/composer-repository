                "description": "<p>It seems like every twitter plugin for WP does one of two things- pushes your blog posts to twitter, or shows your own tweets on your site.<\/p>\n\n<p>I wanted to show tweets of the people I follow on my sidebar, and it seemed like it hadn't been covered yet. Fortunately I knew of an awesome jQuery plugin, Seaofclouds Tweet! - <a href=\"http:\/\/tweet.seaofclouds.com\/-\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/tweet.seaofclouds.com\/-<\/a>\nthat lets you not only show tweets from a twitter list, but also from a search query, and of course just from a specific user. You can customize appearance with CSS and custom templates that control the content\nthat appears in the tweets.<\/p>\n\n<p>A quick port to WP and you now can have all this flexibility from the Settings-&#62;Tweet! menu in your WP Admin. Add tweet feeds from the settings page and then add them to your site using the widget or shortcode.<\/p>\n\n<p>Details on shortcode and custom template use are found on the settings page.<\/p>\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"http:\/",
