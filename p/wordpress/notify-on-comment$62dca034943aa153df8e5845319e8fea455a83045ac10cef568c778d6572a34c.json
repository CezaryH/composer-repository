This is helpful for blogs with many authors that writes on different topics.\nThe message sent is the same message sent from wordpress to the administrator (if you check that option), it's exactly the same code. This means that in the message the you already have the links to allow or discard the comment. \nAnother bonus from using the same code of wordpress base is that it's easier to translate the message in your native language bacause you can use the translation file for wordpress and take the translated template.<\/p>\n\n<p>NEW: now we added a notification panel where you can:\nchoose if you want to be notified only when the comment requires moderation or everytime a comment is added\nsetup the email template using a super template language<\/p>",
