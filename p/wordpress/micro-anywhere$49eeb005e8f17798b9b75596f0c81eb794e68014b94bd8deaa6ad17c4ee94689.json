Each button opens an easy to use dialog box that prompts the user for information about their event or contact, and then outputs a human readable paragraph, fully marked up with a relevant microformat. When possible, relevant HTML tags are used to make interacting with the event easier. For example, if a URL is given, the event or contact's name becomes a link to that URL.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.undergroundwebdesigns.com\/micro-anywhere-wordpress.html\">Extended instructions are available here...<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin is under active development: if you experience problems, please first make sure you have the latest version installed.
