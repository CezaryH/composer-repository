This is helpful for mass communication blogs which have recurring events or regularly scheduled announcements.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, a book club blog could have a post titled - \"Team Leaders' Monthly Meeting\".  In just one click, the admin could schedule a clone of that post to run every 30 days from January through December.<\/p>\n\n<p>After installing, find your post template, click on edit and <strong>scroll to the very bottom of the edit post page<\/strong> to find Repeating Post.<\/p>",
