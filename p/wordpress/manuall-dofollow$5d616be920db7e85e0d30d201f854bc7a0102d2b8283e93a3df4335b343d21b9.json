All other comments have NoFollow, except the Admin enable manually the DoFollow Status. The status which is set manual (if DoFollow or NoFollow) will overrides the automatical process. So, you have the control if someone gets sooner the DoFollow status, or never maybe. Of corse, the automatism can be disabled to do the hole work manually.<\/p>\n\n<p>You get an support automatism, that you don't need to check daily, but have the full control power.<\/p>\n\n<p>Additonal this plugin validated all DoFollow URLs and will notice if there are broken links.
