Micro Themes are created with the premium plugin \"<a title=\"Microthemer - Visual Design Plugin For Customizing Themes &#38; Plugins\" href=\"http:\/\/themeover.com\/microthemer\/\">Microthemer<\/a>\". A Micro Theme is a way of overriding a WordPress theme or plugin's default styling. Micro Themes are a bit like CSS-only Child Themes. The real difference is when you load Micro Themes with Microloader's premium counterpart, Microthemer. When a Micro Theme is loaded with Microthemer, all the CSS styles are editable via a WordPress admin screen designed specifically for non-technical users. Microloader doesn't have this functionality. It has been released as a free plugin for people who would like to download a new skin (Micro Theme) for their favourite WordPress Theme or plugin (e.g. <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/contact-form-7\/\">Contact Form 7<\/a>) and be done with it.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Free,",
