Want to highlight only a few of them to make your site easier to navigate?<\/p>\n\n<p>While redesigning WordPress sites for our clients we kept running into this problem over and over.  They had a huge list of legacy categories but only wanted to highlight a few of them.  We wrote this plugin to allow them to select which categories to show and which categories to initially hide.<\/p>\n\n<p>All categories are still accessible by a \"see all\" link at the bottom of the list.<\/p>\n\n<p>Add the widget to your sidebar to make it live.<\/p>",
