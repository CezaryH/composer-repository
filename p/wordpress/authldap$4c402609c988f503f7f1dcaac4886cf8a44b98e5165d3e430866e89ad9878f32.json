Due to the extensive configuration you can\nfreely decide how to do the authentication of your users. It simply depends on your\nfilters<\/li>\n<li>Independent: As soon as a user logs in, it is added\/updated to the Wordpress' user-database\nto allow wordpress to always use the correct data. You only have to administer your users once.<\/li>\n<li>Failsafe: Due to the users being created in Wordpress' User-database they can\nalso log in when the LDAP-backend currently is gone.<\/li>\n<li>Role-Aware: You can map Wordpress' roles to values of an existing LDAP-attribute.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>For more Information on the configuration have a look at <a href=\"http:\/\/andreas.heigl.org\/cat\/dev\/wp\/authldap\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/andreas.heigl.org\/cat\/dev\/wp\/authldap<\/a><\/p>",
