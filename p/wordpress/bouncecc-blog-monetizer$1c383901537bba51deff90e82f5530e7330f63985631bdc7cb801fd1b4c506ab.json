Visitors who click these links will be transported transparently to the destination of the original link, but it will be rewritten to take advantage of any affiliate program you are signed up for through the Bounce service. And because it does this &#8220;on-the-fly&#8221;, both your new and old content, as well as all of the comments on your blog can be monetized. This plugin was custom built for the <a href=\"http:\/\/bounce.cc\/\" title=\"Monetize your site with Bounce!\">Bounce.cc<\/a> web service and requires an account there to take full advantage of what this plugin has to offer.<\/p>\n\n<p>More info and support for this plugin can be found on the <a href=\"http:\/\/bounce.cc\/\" title=\"Monetize your site with Bounce!\">Bounce site<\/a>.<\/p>",
