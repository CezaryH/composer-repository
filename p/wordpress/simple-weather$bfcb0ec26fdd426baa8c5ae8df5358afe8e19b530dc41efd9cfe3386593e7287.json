Makes use of \"secret\" Google Weather API, which is\nunofficial, yet XML-based and lightweight, and is used by developers quite often. \nThe plugin uses cURL, so works even on hosts with some security restricions, like url-disabled file_get_contents.<br \/>\nIf you've downloaded it, consider leaving feedback in my <a href=\"http:\/\/recon-by-fire.eu\/guestbook1.php\">guestbook<\/a>, it's\nrather important for me.
