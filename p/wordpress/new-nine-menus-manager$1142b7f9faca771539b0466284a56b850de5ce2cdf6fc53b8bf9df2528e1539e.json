Because we're tired of jumping back and forth between our functions file and the dashboard. Because we're tired of writing <code>register_nav_menu<\/code> over and over again every time we start a new site.<\/p>\n\n<p>And because there seems to be a disconnect here - just about every site needs to have a navigation menu, there are no configuration options for <code>register_nav_menu<\/code>, and it just seems to make sense to be able to create and delete menu locations in the dashboard.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin was built by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newnine.com\/\" title=\"New Nine Media &#38; Advertising\">New Nine Media &#38; Advertising<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Single Site &#38; Network Compatible<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The New Nine Menus Manager works on both individual sites and WordPress Networks.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>MU Comp",
