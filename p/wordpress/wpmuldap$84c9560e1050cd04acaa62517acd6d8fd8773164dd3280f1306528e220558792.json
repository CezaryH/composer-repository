Both the automatic creation of users and the automatic creation of blogs are configurable options.<\/p>\n\n<p>LDAP authentication is configured on a site-wide (as opposed to per-blog) level, so only Network Admin accounts have access to the configuration to LDAP connection information.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please make sure you have PHP compiled with LDAP support.  This will show up as an LDAP section in your phpinfo() if it is correct.<\/p>\n\n<p>Remember - all the code for the plugin was contributed by volunteers, and you can show your gratitude by giving back to the community!<\/p>",
