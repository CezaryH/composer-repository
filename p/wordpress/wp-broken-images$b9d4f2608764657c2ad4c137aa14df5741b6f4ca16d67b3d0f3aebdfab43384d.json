It works by inserting a JavaScript snippet in the \noutput HTML code of your pages, which attaches itself to the \n<em>onError=\"..\"<\/em> events of the images, so if an image fails to \nload, this JS snippet is fired. You can customize what actions you want to \nperform on the broken images: hide them, style-them, replace them, etc - all \nthis from the WordPress admin panel.<\/p>",
