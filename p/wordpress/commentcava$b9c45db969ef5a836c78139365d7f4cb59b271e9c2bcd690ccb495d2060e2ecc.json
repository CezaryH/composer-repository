The waiting message is currently displayed in English (default) or German, according to the browser settings.<\/p>\n\n<p>This project was subject of my story about blog comments in c't Magazin 17\/2013.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wishlist:\n*  add more languages, maybe via WordPress plugin i18n\n*  use WordPress options for settings (reading speed, waiting messages, locked comment styling)<\/p>",
