This plugin makes it easy to give each post a postal address and build a map of those posts. Each marker automatically inherits the post title, excerpt and permalink so readers can easily navigate to the full post. This version includes limited support for directions. This map can be placed on a page through either a widget or a shortcode.<\/p>",
