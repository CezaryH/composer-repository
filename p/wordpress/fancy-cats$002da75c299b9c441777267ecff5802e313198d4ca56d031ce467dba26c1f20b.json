You can set:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A limit on the height of the expanded area, so that a scroll bar will show if you have lots of posts in a category<\/li>\n<li>The indentation of the post items<\/li>\n<li>The title text, the instructional text, and the 'show all' text<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The expanding\/collapsing of category post lists is done via AJAX, so the entire page doesn't have to continuously reload to perform the operation.<\/p>\n\n<p>If there is an extra feature you would like added, or something that you don't like and want to be able to change yourself, contact me and I will see about adding it in the next version.<\/p>",
