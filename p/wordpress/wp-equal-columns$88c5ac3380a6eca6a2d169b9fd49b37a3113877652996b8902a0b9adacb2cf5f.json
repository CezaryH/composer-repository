Basically this plugin will equalize the columns in your theme to ensure that they are of equal lengths.<\/p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Your theme must use the following column names: \"rightnav\",\"bodycontent\",\"leftnav\",\"sidebar\",\"sidebar1?,\"sidebar2?,\"content\".<\/p>\n\n<p>You can modify the equalcolumns.js Line 2 to contain any column definitions you may have for your theme<\/p>\n\n<p>All the information (general, changelog, installation, upgrade, usage) you need about this plugin can be found here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kennedymedia.com\/wp-equal-columns\/\" title=\"WP-equal-columns Readme\">WP-Equal-columns Readme<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>NOTE:  I did not write the js script.  I would give credit to whoever wrote it, but it doesn't contain any author information.  If you wrote this js, then contact me, I will add your credits here.<\/p>",
