Perfect for sites where the site owner just wants to correspond through email before any sale is made. Products can be entered into a post via shortcode or through inserting a PHP function into the loop. Go to settings &#62; quote cart to view these codes. All Quote requests are stored in a table which is visible at settings &#62; quote requests also.<\/p>",
