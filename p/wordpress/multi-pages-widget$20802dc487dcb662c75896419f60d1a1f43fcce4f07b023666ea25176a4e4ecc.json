                "description": "<p>The Sidebar Widget Plugin is a really nice plugin but I thought that it would a lot more convenient \nto have a mixture between the 9 texts widget and the page widget. So I did the Multi Pages Widget which \nmakes it so much easier to organize your pages into your sidebar. It's exactly like the normal page widget but with\nan option to give a title, and an another one to select subpages besides you can 9 of them!<\/p>\n\n<p>Usage: In the Themes-&#62;Sidebar Widget you see in the available widget section the Multi Pages Widget, \nwhich you can drag and drop on your sidebar. You can create more Multi Pages widget by using the menu at the bottom. \nYou can add a Title which should be displayed in the title of the widget. If you leave the title empty only the root page title is displayed. \nIf a page does not have any child pages this widget is not displayed.<\/p>",
