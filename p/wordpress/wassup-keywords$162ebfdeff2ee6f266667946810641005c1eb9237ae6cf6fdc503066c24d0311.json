(Obviously you need Wassup installed.)<\/p>\n\n<p>You can also check your Google rankings for any of the keywords with the click of a button\nif they came from Google. A neat little way of seeing which keyword phrases are working for\nyou so you can optimize your blog and posts for them even more, as even a slight change in \nyour ranking for a phrase can bring in extra traffic.<\/p>",
