What can motivate visitors? I think it can be something tasty available only in feed. So I made WordPress plugin FeedOnly which hides from blog visitors the parts of posts you want to show only to your subscribers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Parts to be hidden for visitors have to be enclosed in tags &#60;!\u0096\u0096hide\u0096\u0096&#62; and &#60;!\u0096\u0096\/hide\u0096\u0096&#62;. These parts will be available for RSS subscribers only and that will be said to visitors.<\/p>",
