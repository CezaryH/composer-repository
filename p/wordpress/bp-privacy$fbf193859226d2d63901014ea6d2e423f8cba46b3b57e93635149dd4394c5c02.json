                "description": "<p>The BuddyPress Privacy Component (also referred to as BP Privacy, BuddyPress Authorization component, BP_Authz, or BPAz) is a BuddyPress component that provides users with fine, granular control over who has access to which pieces of their BuddyPress-core generated personal data. It provides this service by hooking into BuddyPress' core functionality, thereby giving users the ability to control (grant or deny) access to each piece, or grouping of, their BuddyPress-core generated personal data. It does not offer privacy filtering services for data generated by 3rd-party BuddyPress components.<\/p>\n\n<p>BP Privacy deals with authorization by verifying and managing access rights an authenticated user has to another user&#8217;s objects. The plugin also provides the option for a user to choose to expose their data to non-logged in, non-authenticated users as well (which is the default behavior for BuddyPress).<\/p>\n\n<p>The core BuddyPress objects on which rights can be set:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>p",
