A page will be created that shows the information that you typed into the description field of your image as well as a link back to the place in the document where the reader left off.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can create a custom template in your theme's folder to further style the Long Description page. I would suggest creating a copy of the longdesc-template.php file from this plugin in your active theme (or child theme) and reworking it to fit your needs.<\/p>",
