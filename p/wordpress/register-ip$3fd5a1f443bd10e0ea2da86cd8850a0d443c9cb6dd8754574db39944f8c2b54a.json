You would be able to see it in WordPress by \nlogging into WordPress with an account that has access to the users menu. \nYou will be able to see the IP listed with each user and in their profile \nwhen you go to edit it. For security purposes their IP is not displayed to \nthem when they see their profile. This plugin was made to assist those that \nare tired of trying to match a IP up with the persons registered date so that \nthe administrator can block the IP from making more accounts or access the \nsite. Especially useful if you block a problematic person that spams \nyour blog.<\/p>",
