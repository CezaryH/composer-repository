There are three ways to get the videos onto your page:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If your theme already makes use of  <a href=\"http:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Post_Thumbnails\">Featured Images<\/a>, these will in most themes <strong>automatically<\/strong> be replaced by your Featured Videos if available. Alternatively you can<\/li>\n<li>insert the <code>[featured-video-plus]<\/code>-<strong>Shortcode<\/strong> in your posts or<\/li>\n<li>manually make use of the <strong>PHP functions<\/strong> in your theme's source files.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Instead of option 1 the plugin can also request the videos using an AJAX request when the featured image is clicked. This reduces load times and gives you the flexibility to display videos in a lightbox to ensure your theme does not break.<\/p>\n\n<p>See the theme in action on <a href=\"http:\/\/y",
