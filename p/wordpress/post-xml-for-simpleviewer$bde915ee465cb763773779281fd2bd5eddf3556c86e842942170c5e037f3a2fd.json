                "description": "<p>This plugin generates an XML for every post using Wordpress' gallery data system so you can use the generated XML with the Simpleviewer Flash gallery.<\/p>\n\n<p>After installing and activating the plugin, XML files are generated simply by visiting a single post in a browser. Basically, the file generates each time someone looks at a specific post (not an index or archive page), so the XML is updating each time a single post is visited. If you get a ton of traffic, this might not be the best solution for you due to potential server overload.<\/p>\n\n<p>The XML generated for each post will be located in a folder called 'SVxmlfiles' within your wp-content folder. Each filename will be galleryXXX.xml where the XXX is your post ID number. For example, the location of the XML for this post is:\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lauragentry.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/SVxmlfiles\/gallery343.xml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.lauragentry.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/SVxmlfiles\/gallery343.xml<\/a><\/p>",
