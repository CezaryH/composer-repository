You can choose to show either the Standard or Small size badge, and you can show as many different badges on a page or post as you choose - each with their own configuration.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can also show a Google+ badge using template tags in your theme files or in a page or post using the simple shortcode (See FAQs for instructions).<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:<\/strong> Google+ only allows this type of badge for a Google+ <em>page<\/em> and not a personal Google+ <em>profile<\/em>, so this plugin will only work for Google+ business <em>pages<\/em>.<\/p>",
