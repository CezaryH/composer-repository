The welcome messages are based on templates which you can write yourself (as many templates as you like). Once a message is sent that user won't appear again.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are four extra management features:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to set all users as having been sent a welcome message (an easy way to bulk remove everyone from the list, for example when the plugin is first installed)<\/li>\n<li>The ability to search for a user and send them a welcome message<\/li>\n<li>The ability to set the new user as being spam<\/li>\n<li>The ability to set the new user and all their blogs as spam<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Of course, the templates don't have to be just for welcoming people - they could contain FAQs, help information or anything else.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin also makes use of the __() function to allow for easy translation.<\/p>",
