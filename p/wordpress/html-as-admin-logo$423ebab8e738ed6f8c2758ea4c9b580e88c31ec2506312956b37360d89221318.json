Useful for using Google Web Fonts for logo instead of using an image as a WordPress administration logo.<\/p>\n\n<p>This has been created plug-in because I need a decent logo to replace the WordPress logo in the wp-admin login page. I have to compensate with my lack of graphics design skills and came up with this plug-in. Works execellent with your Google Web Font of choice.<\/p>",
