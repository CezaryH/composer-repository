It works with the eHive Search plugin to give your site the potential for eHive search capability on every page.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because this is a widget plugin it can be added to sidebars, footers or any other page section that allows widgets. This also means the widget's functionality can be made available on every page of your site.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before you install this plugin you will need to install the eHive Access and eHive Object Search plugins. While eHive search will function and return results without the eHive Object Details plugin, it is likely that you will want to install the eHive Object Details plugin so your users can click through and view the Object Record in detail.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Get more from the eHive plugi",
