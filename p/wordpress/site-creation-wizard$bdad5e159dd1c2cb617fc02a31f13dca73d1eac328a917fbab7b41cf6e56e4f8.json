Each template gives the user preconfigured content, theme, set of plugins and set of options. This helps users get started without having to know how to configure their sites.<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, users are given a set of features they can turn on. Each feature is essentially a set of related plugins that are preconfigured.<\/p>\n\n<p>Users can get the site creation form by click on the '<strong>Create New Site<\/strong>' link under the Dashboard Menu. (this is added by the plugin.)<\/p>\n\n<h4>Templates<\/h4>\n\n<p>Templates are controlled by sites within your Multi-site environment. A template site should be configured exactly as you want new sites to be. When a new site is created, all content, options, turned on plugins and plugin options are copied from the template site ",
