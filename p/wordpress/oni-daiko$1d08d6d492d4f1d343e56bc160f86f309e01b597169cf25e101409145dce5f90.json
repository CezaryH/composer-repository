People in Sado Island used to play the dance-drama for exorcism, success in business, and good harvests.<\/p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately there was no relation between this plugin Oni daiko and the traditional dance-drama. Instead it provides a function that shows a list of the latest posts from all blogs under your WordPress Multisite\nAlso it supports widgets and outputs RSS feeds.<\/p>",
