Maybe you want 1 post in the last week, 3 in the last month, 12 in the last year \u0096 its completely up to you.<\/p>\n\n<p>Everything is automated. When a writer qualifies, their link will appear without any input from you. If they ever no longer qualify, their link will simply vanish until they qualify again.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the settings you can select any writers that you want to block from the list. You can also choose whether it displays sitewide or homepage only.<\/p>\n\n<p>We have currently applied to Wordpress to have our plugin hosted on Wordpress.org, please check back soon for the download link.<\/p>",
