This is great for using with Twitter RSS feed tools that can push your feed into your Twitter stream.<\/p>\n\n<p>You might have seen @techcrunch sends its tweets in the format: \"article title <a href=\"http:\/\/link.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/link.com<\/a> by @username\"<\/p>\n\n<p>This tool does very similar and you can customise how your feed looks by creating your own template.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once that is done you can see your feed at <a href=\"http:\/\/your-blog-url.com\/?feed=tweetified\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/your-blog-url.com\/?feed=tweetified<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>BEWARE: This tool does not work if you have the FeedBurner redirection plugin.<\/p>",
