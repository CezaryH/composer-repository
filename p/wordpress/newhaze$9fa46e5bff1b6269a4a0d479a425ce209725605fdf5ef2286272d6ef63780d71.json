The Wordpress plugin lets you manage your newhaze site directly from your Wordpress administration panel. This means that you don't need to bother logging into other websites to edit your site - just log into Wordpress and you're away. Once you're in, you can add games from the game library which currently has over 65,000 games. Add game categories, then select the category when you add the game to your site. It couldn't be simpler!<\/p>",
