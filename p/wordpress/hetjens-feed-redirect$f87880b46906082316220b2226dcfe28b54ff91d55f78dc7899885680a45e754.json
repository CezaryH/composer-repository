In comparision to the original Feedsmith-plug-in is has three advantages:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It redirects only the two main feeds of the blog and not all. The category, tag and author feeds are still accessible<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>If you need access to the original blog feed you can add the URL parameter \"noredirect\" (i.e. \/feed\/?noredirect) to your feed address and it will not forward your request.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>The Plugin is more integrated into the administration interface. It adds its settings to the default \"reading\" settings pages and do not create an own page.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>",
