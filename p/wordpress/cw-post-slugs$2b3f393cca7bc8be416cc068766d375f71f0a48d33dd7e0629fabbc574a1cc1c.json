Or perhaps you change your mind a few dozen times before you settle on the best title possible. Have you ever noticed that WordPress picks your post slug before you are ready? This plugin is the solution! It automatically updates your slug to the WordPress recommended value when you save your post, so you never have to worry about your slug being wrong again.<\/p>",
