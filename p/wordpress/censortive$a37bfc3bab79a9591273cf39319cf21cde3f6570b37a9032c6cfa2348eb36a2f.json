                "description": "<p>Censortive uses text-to-image technology to convert user-defined 'sensitive' words into an image file that blends right into the flow of text. By changing the text into an image file, you effectively negate the censorship robots from being able to 'see' the offending words. Your readers, however, will be able to follow what you're saying without a hitch.<\/p>\n\n<p>In some countries Internet censorship is at an unjustified level, with a host of Big Brother technologies working to block one of our basic human rights: freedom of speech. The most common way for them to do this is by using bots to scan the text from a site attempting to be viewed. If words deemed inappropriate are found, the viewer is left with an error screen.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, by converting the words into small, near-identical to the original text, graphic files, the robots have no idea what is being said and happily let it all pass through.<\/p>\n\n<p>To further increase security, rather than have the sensitive words saved ",
