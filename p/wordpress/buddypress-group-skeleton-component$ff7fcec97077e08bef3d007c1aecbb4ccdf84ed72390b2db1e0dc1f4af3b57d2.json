With some simple extra functionality, you can transform the function of your groups and even your site.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin preforms a basic function - save group meta ( data ) via thr group creating process and\/or via 'edit group details' and returns the data on the group's home page.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is the basis for the existing Buddypress Twitter, Buddypress Google Plus and Buddypress Klout plugins - They all preform the same basic function, though as you can see, can be used in a variety of ways.<\/p>",
