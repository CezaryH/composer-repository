The plugin then combines them into one before inserting the result into the head of your website.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is my first plugin for WPMU. Please let me know if you find anything that I should be doing differently.<\/p>\n\n<p>To adjust the site wide keywords and description:\n* Sign in as a site administrator\n* Navigate to the Site Admin page\n* Click on the Site MetaTags link.<\/p>\n\n<p>To adjust the keywords and description for a single blog:\n* Login as the blog administrator\n* Navigate to the settings tab in the backend.\n* Click on the MetaTags link<\/p>",
