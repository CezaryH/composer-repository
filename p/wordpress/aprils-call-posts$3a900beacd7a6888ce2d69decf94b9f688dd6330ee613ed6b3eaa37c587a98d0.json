For example, You may have a blog with lots of information on upcoming events and lots of announcements. You have a variety of people who come to your blog looking for different information, and it's hard for them to filter through everything. You can have a \"Cats\" page on which you talk about your stance on cats, and use <code>[ahs_callposts]<\/code> to also call in a list of posts in the \"cats\" category, perhaps only the most recent 10, perhaps just titles, perhaps displaying just excerpts, perhaps displaying an image for each post. Then have a separate page for the \"dogs\" category. Etc!<\/p>",
