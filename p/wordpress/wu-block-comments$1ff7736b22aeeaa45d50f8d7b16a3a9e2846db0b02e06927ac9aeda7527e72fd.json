The built-in lists of wordpress only allow to send comments to the moderation- or to the spam-queue but not to block them completely. This is remedied with this plugin, which allows to block comments based on a definable list.<\/p>\n\n<p>Attention #1: Use wordlist with care, there is no logging of the blocked comments!<\/p>\n\n<p>Attention #2: It will also match inside words, so \"press\" will match \"WordPress\" as well!<\/p>",
