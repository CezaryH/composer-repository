If your post doesn't have a featured image then it will use a fall-back image that you can specify in Settings -&#62; General.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin forces the open graph meta properties into the head of each page and post: og:image, og:title and og:url, which both Facebook and Google+ scan for when someone shares your web page.<\/p>",
