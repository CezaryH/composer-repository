It allows you to quickly embed videos into your posts, pages or comments. After the plug-in is installed, you will see either the video button or the Simfany button in your editor. Copy the video embed code or the video link from Youtube or any other video resource and paste it between the [video] tags. It will convert your embed code or the link into very simple Simfany format.<\/p>",
