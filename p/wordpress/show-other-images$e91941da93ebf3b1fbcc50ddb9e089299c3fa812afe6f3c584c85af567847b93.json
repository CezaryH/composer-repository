Only images are shown, that are not contained within the teaser-text, so visitors can have a teaser of further images of the post along the teaser-text and may not overlook some beautiful photos that are not displayed in the teaser-text on the home page.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin only contains one line of displayed text, but it's already translateable. If you want to use it in a currently unsupported language, feel free to contact me so I may extend the language files with that language.<\/p>",
