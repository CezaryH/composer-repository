I created this simple lightbox after weeks of dealing with jQuery conflicts within Buddypress and Wordpress.  Many of the existing jQuery type lightboxes do not stop audio playback for flash\/.swf playback when closing the lightbox.  This plugin completely removes the overlay content from the dom to make absolutely sure your .swf file playback is stopped in all browsers.<\/p>",
