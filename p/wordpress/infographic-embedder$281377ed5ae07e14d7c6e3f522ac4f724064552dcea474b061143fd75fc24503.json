Readers can also edit the width of the image in the embed code to either percent or pixels (the default is 100%).<\/p>\n\n<p>While it was built with infographics in mind, you can certainly use any image you'd like.<\/p>\n\n<p>Want to improve the plugin or add a feature? <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Pardot\/wp-embed-infographic\">Fork it on GitHub<\/a> and let's work on it!<\/p>",
