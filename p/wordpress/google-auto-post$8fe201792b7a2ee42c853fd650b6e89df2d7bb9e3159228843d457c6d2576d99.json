It gives you a way to automatically share your posts to Google Plus from the WordPress post-editing screen. It works by firing off an email to the Google Voice email address, which is then posted to Google Plus.<\/p>\n\n<p>IMPORTANT: Setup Information<\/p>\n\n<p>Notes: Setup requires taking advantage of a loophole in Google Voice which allows you to post to Google+ via email. To start, make sure you have a Google Plus account and a Google Voice account under the same email address.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Log in to Google Voice. Click on the Settings \"Gear\" icon in the upper-right corner.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Verify you have a Google Voice phone number. If you don't, select one.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Click on the \"Voicemail &#38; Text\" tab. Check the box next to \"Forward text messages to my email.\"<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Click on \"Text,\" and compose a message to 33669 (in the USA) or 9222222222 (in India).<\/p><\/",
