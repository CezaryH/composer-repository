Tynt.com For WordPress tries to solve this problem by bringing configuration option to WordPress admin panel.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once installed you control:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If script is active or not<\/li>\n<li>Place of invocation of the script (header, footer, custom placement)<\/li>\n<li>Prefix and suffix to the link<\/li>\n<li>Link formatting<\/li>\n<li>Link sponsors and sponsors url<\/li>\n<\/ul>",
