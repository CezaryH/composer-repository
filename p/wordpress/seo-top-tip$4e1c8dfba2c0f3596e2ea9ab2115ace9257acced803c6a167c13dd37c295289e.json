                "description": "<p>The SEO Top Tip plugin displays a customizable message tip at the top of the content area just above the first post on the homepage. It can be used to serve a tip to both visitors and search engines alike. Once its installed, and activated, the plugin can be configured from the WordPress administration panel. The webmaster of the blog can set whatever text, he or she likes as the tip to display and at the same time can choose to apply a set of predefined HTML tags and various CSS properties, all from the WordPress administration panel!<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin has been programmed in such a way that it displays this tip only on the homepage just above the first post and no where else. This ensures that the plugin won't cause any duplicate content issues. The plugin works, even if the webmaster uses a static front page.<\/p>\n\n<p>Check out some of the other <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spunkyjones.com\/\">WordPress plugins<\/a> by the same author.<\/p>",
