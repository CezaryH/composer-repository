Thus, a page can be translated in X languages.<\/p>\n\n<p>The architecture chosen for development is fully consistent with WordPress 3.0, we created a content type translation, and we created a taxonomy for the site languages. \nWe customized the WordPress admin console to provide the translation functionality, a bit of AJAX to make the convenient interface. Finally, we created a widget that displays the languages available for the currently loaded content.<\/p>\n\n<p>A translator role is automatically created with the plugin, it allows a user to this role only to create and manage translations.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin offers settings:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic insertion of languages available to the end of the article<\/li>\n<li>Language detection URL : via a \"lang\" parameter in the addr",
