                "description": "<p>BestBooks For Wordpress originally was developed in Java, the original framework.\nThe goal behind Bestbooks is to provide an accounting application framework modelled\nafter common accounting terms (t-account,ledger,jornal) and the GAAP (Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles) while providing open database connectivity. At the time,\naccounting frameworks had a proprietary, closed database structure. The original Bestbooks\nfor Java has connectivity for multiple databases including MSSQL, DB2, Oracle and MySQL.<\/p>\n\n<p>BestBooks for Wordpress is a minimal accounting framework.<\/p>\n\n<p>BestBooks for Wordpress has enough functionality that you can create\nworkable scripts that solve accounting problems. You will be able to\nimplement many of the accounting problems on the accounting\nlearning website, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplestudies.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.simplestudies.com<\/a><\/p>",
