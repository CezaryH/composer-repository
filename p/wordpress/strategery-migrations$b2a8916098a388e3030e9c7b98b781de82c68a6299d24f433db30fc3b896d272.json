Migrations scripts are used to edit content on a blog to blog basis by running php files which manipulate your Wordpress database. This could be adding or removing a page or post to certain blogs. Strategery Migrations also provides an interface to manage your migrations scripts. You can view a list of all migrations files and see a timestamp indicating when a migration file was created. You can see individual blogs' migration state so that you can tell what files have been run or if a certain blog has been migrated. You can look at a list of all your blogs and see what their migration states are compared to each other.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin was made for Wordpress implementations using a multisite network with sub-directories.<\/p>",
