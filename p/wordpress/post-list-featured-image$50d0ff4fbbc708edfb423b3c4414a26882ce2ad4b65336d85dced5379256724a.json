It lets the wordpress site owners see which posts or pages have its featured image set.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is mainly intended for use on the Post List page, since most themes require a featured image be set for the excerpt thumbnail image. It doesn't seem like much, and the plugin is truly non-invasive to the rest fo the WP install. But the value that this simple tool can have on the overall organization for Admins and Developers of WordPress websites is priceless.<\/p>",
