The most popular tags are then added automatically to your post, and helps organize your blog. It helps you tag your old posts, or get a large database of relevant tags, and better interaction with the community.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Tag This\" was an idea conceived by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brajeshwar.com\/\" title=\"Brajeshwar\">Brajeshwar<\/a> and written in whole by Anirudh (anirudh -at- anirudhsanjeev -dot- org), and released under GPLv3 License. Small parts of the code are used from Lester Chan's wp-ratings plugin (under provision of GPLv2), and it uses the OneClick framework, under LGPL2 license.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Tag This\" requires Wordpress 2.3 or higher. There is no possibility of it working with any previous versions. Support for older versions with Ultimate Tag Warrior may be released, but wordpress 2.3 is required.<\/p>",
