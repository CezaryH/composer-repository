If there is no excerpt, the extend (before the <code>&#60;!--more--&#62;<\/code> tag) is used and if there is no extend, one is computed (55 first words) and used.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can choose to put a link to the article or not. That behavior can be chanched for each articles by using a custom boolean var (articles2sidebar_display_link : 1 force link &#124;",
