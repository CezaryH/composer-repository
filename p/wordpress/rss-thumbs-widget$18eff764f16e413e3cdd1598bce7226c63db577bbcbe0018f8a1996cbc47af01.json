I created it to showcase the latest posts from my daughters&#8217; blogs with thumbnails of the posts along with the title of the post and a link to the original post.<\/p>\n\n<p>I wrote this because I was originally trying to use the very nice KB Advanced RSS Widget, but apparently, the feed parser in WordPress doesn&#8217;t support enclosures.  I still use the KB widget for other feeds on my blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since I&#8217;m using SimplePie, I also could have just included the necessary SimplePie code in my template, but I wanted to include it with the other widgets on my blog and be able to move it around from within the WP Admin.  Besides, what&#8217;s the fun in that?<\/p>",
