                "description": "<p>The Auto Thickbox plugin for WordPress automatically enables thickbox on thumbnail images (i.e. opens the images in a fancy pop-up), through the use of WordPress' built-in thickbox library.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the event you'd like to override this for an individual image, you can disable the behavior by adding the 'nothickbox' class to its anchor tag.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Thickbox Galleries<\/h4>\n\n<p>By default, the auto thickbox plugin will bind all images within a post into a single thickbox gallery. That is, next image and previous image links will appear so you can navigate from an image to the next.<\/p>\n\n<p>The behavior is particularly interesting when you create galleries using WordPress' image uploader. Have the images link to the image file rather than the attachment's post, and you're done.<\/p>\n\n<p>On occasion, you'll want to split a subset of images into a separate gallery. Auto Thickbox lets you do this as well: add an identical rel attribute to each anchor you'd like to group, and you're done",
