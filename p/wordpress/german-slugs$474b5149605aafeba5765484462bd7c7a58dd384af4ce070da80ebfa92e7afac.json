                "description": "<p>While creating a post or page, WordPress automatically suggests a permalink. If\nyour permalink structure contains the %postname% tag, then the title of your\npost or page will be used, simplified by conversion to lowercase, replacing\nspaces with hyphens, removing certain punctuation characters and removing\ndiacritics from latin letters.<\/p>\n\n<p>Thus, by default, &#228; is replaced with a, &#246; with o, &#252; with u and &#223; with s (similar\nfor capital letters). For German, the conventional transliteration is &#228; to ae, &#246;\nto oe, &#252; to ue and &#223; to ss (sometimes sz in Austria, this is not yet supported).\nThis plugin makes your WordPress apply the conventional transliteration.<\/p>\n\n<p>I wrote this plugin because manually correcting WordPress's suggestions is a\nconsiderable hassle, especially if you decide to change the title afterwards.<\/p>",
