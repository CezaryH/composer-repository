This is ideal for branding your videos, making them\nload faster, look cleaner and respond to the width of the browser\/device.<\/p>\n\n<p>An alternate feature of this Plugin is to simply make your iFrame video embeds fully responsive\nso that they perfectly fit any smaller browser window or device.<\/p>\n\n<p>Either feature will wrap your iFrame video embeds in unique HTML divs which allow you to easily style\nyour videos independently or as a whole.<\/p>\n\n<p>See more of my work over at <a href=\"http:\/\/catalysttheme.com\">CatalystTheme.com<\/a>.<\/p>",
