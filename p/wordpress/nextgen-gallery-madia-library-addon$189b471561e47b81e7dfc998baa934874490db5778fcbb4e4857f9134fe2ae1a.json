For large websites with hundreds and hundreds of images, like some of my high profile clients, this can add strain on the server, causing long page load times, in turn effecting Google rankings.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, with our NextGEN Gallery Media Library Addon, you will have the option of adding images that are already stored in your Media Library. Just like adding an image to a page or post, adding an image to your NextGEN Gallery can be a matter of clicking a button and finding an image you have already uploaded.<\/p>",
