In the olden days you would read part of an article on\nthe front page, and then open the paper up to the right section to continue.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's also great for annoying readers, but you need those ad impressions!<\/p>\n\n<p>Follow <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/broadstreetads\">@broadstreetads<\/a> for updates, or visit\n<a href=\"http:\/\/broadstreetads.com\">broadstreetads.com<\/a><\/p>",
