You can check or uncheck categories and then hit any one of the submit buttons and your posts will be put into the categories you've chosen<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I've used this for 200 posts.  I dont really know what will happen if you try to change 2000 posts at a time.<\/li>\n<li>I am going to try to implement a paging feature so that huge post lists wont crash anything.<\/li>\n<li>The compatability i've listed simply means it's what i've used it on.  This will probly work on any &#62;3 wp version.<\/li>\n<li>If it works for you, please click 'works' on the right over there.  If it doesnt, start a thread on the support tab :)<\/li>\n<\/ul>",
