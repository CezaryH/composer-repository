Now with topsy.com blocker.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How it works:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>When a trackback is received, this plugin<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>checks for topsy.com trackbacks and marks this as spam.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>checks if the IP address of the trackback sender is equal to the IP address of the webserver the trackback URL is referring to. This reveals almost every spam trackback (more than 99%) since spammers do usually use bots which are not running on the machine of their customers.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>retrieves the web page located at the URL included in the trackback. If the page doesn&#8217;t a link to your blog, the trackback is considered to be spam. Since most trackback spammers do not set up custom web pages linking to the blogs they attack, this simple test will quickly reveal illegitimate trackbacks. Also, bloggers can be stopped abusing trackback ",
