If used incorrectly it could wipe out <em>all your content<\/em>!<\/p>\n\n<p>Keeping databases in sync between development, staging and live servers can be a pain. This plugin lets you\nlink together several WordPress installations by sharing a secret token. Once linked, administrators can pull\nor push the entire database between servers with just a click.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently syncs database only, not uploaded files.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Backups<\/h4>\n\n<p>The plugin will attempt to make local backups of the database before overwriting. These are stored as gzipped SQL\nfiles in wp-content\/plugins\/database-sync\/backups\/dbYYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.sql.gz The backups directory should be made\nwritable, and you should keep an eye on it if you sync often as it will grow in size.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Usage<\/h4>\n\n<p>See Installation instructions.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/outlandishideas.co.uk\/\">Plugin by Outlandish Ideas<\/a><\/p>",
