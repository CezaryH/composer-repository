If validation is successfull, customer is redirected to the success url (the product he is paying for), if not to the failure one.<\/p>\n\n<p>With Starpress plugin, do forget how hard it could be to insert php or javascript code into your posts : just insert shortcodes and get your Starpass micropaiment form working<\/p>",
