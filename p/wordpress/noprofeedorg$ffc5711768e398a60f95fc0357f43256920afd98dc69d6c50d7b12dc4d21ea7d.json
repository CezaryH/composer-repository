Finally the blogger sets a number of parameters about what kind of contents will be presented by the widget, including the country where the non-profit organization operates, the language of the feed, one or more tags (such as: education, environment, etc.). From that moment on the plugin will take care to download the relevant data once a day and to feed it to the widget.<\/p>\n\n<p>What a better way to help non-profit organizations?<\/p>\n\n<p>Related Links:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"http:\/\/noprofeed.org\/\" title=\"noprofeed.org: the official site\"",
