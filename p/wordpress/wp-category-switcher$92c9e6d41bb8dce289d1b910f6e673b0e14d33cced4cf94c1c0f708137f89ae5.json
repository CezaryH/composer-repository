Once it's done, the plugin can be uninstalled: it is clean and straighforward.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you do it on a long-time running blog and running many plugins, please do a backup of your database. This plugin updates the WPML databases as well, but it might cause troubles for other plugins (please let me know if it is the case and I will support them).<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Roman <a href='http:\/\/www.roman-kaeppeler.de\/wordpress\/change-category-id'>for his ideas<\/a> from which this plugin is inspired from :)<\/p>\n\n<p>Languages: English, French.<\/p>",
