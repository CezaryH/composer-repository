This facilitates a strategic approach that keeps authors working towards the overall business or site goals.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that this plugin requires another plugin to work properly: <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/front-end-editor\/\" title=\"Front-end Editor\">Front-end Editor<\/a> (you'll be prompted to install and activate it, so no need to take notes now :) )<\/p>",
