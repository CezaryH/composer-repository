                "description": "<p>The main reason for building this plugin is because wordpress doesn't readily have a central registry system where things can be stored such as variable values, objects, arrays. Which can be retrieved from a global space. This plugin basically tries to  lessen the repeating declarations of variables and etc. It is something quite similar to Magento registry \"Mage_Registry\", but very light version.<\/p>\n\n<p>This plugin can also be used as GET and POST request parameters handler. The benefit is, you don't have to check isset($_GET['myparam']) or isset($_POST['myparam']). If the param is not set, it will return a default value you supplied in second param. By default, the default value is false.<\/p>\n\n<p>Handle the session data as easy as never before. Save to session, check existance, get, unset it easily using dynamic methods.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hope this could be of some use.<\/p>\n\n<p>Usage is very easy, neat and straight forward:<\/p>\n\n<p>Register a dynamic method on the fly:\n    registry()-&#62;",
