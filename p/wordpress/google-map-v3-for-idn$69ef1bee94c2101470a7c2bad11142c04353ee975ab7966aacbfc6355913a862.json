It enables to insert maps in your posts and pages from an address while Simple Google Map requires a latitude and a longitude. \nWith this plugin you can insert a google map into your posts, pages, or wigitized sidebar. For this plugin, you will need an API key for geocoding. Google recently released version 3 of their Maps API. They made it smaller and faster, but with less features. If you run a blog or a site with an international domain name (IDN), which means your URL is directly written in French or Spanish with accents (&#224;,&#233;,&#241;...), in Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, Hebrew, Thai, Arabic..., this plugin is for you. The versions 1 and 2 of the Google Maps API were creating an error message if you add a map on your IDN site. Now with the version 3, that problem was solved.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>FEATURES<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Insert into posts or pages us",
