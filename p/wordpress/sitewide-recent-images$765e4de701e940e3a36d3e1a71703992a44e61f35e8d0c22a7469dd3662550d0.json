It's highly optimized to be scalable for large networks, so it should need only about 100 database queries even for a network of thousands of sites. And to keep any performance drain as minimal as possible, the plugin utilizes caching with an adjustable update interval.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Note that images are taken only from blogs and posts which don't have privacy options enabled (compatible with <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/more-privacy-options\/\">More Privacy Options<\/a>) and the image must be attached to a post. So essentially, only public images are shown.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The widget formatting is completely customizable via a template and\/or CSS (if available). The template uses patterns that will plug in values for the following:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Image Title<\/li>\n<li>Image Caption<\/li>\n<li>Image Description<\/li>\n<li>Image Thumbnail URL<\/li>\n<li>Full ",
