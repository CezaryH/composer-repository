They're widgets so you can setup <a href=\"http:\/\/game.hgo.se\/cat\/projects\/3d-games\/\">the awesome tree navigation<\/a> with drag &#38; drop ease, but it also exposes several <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/extend\/plugins\/wp-dtree-30\/other_notes\/\">new template tags<\/a> for developers.<\/p>\n\n<p>WP-dTree 4.x is a complete re-write, bringing the plugin up to speed with the much matured WordPress 3 API. The overhaul has made WP-dTree significantly more sane and robust; it supports multiple widget instances, \"foreign\" characters, is more in tune with your themes, plays nice with translators and offers true fallbacks for those who surf without JavaScript.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you value <a href=\"http:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/users\/ulfben\/\">my plugins<\/a>, please help me out by <a href=\"http:\/\/flattr.com\/thing\/367557\/Support-my-WordPres",
