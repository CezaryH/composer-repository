The idea is to be able to use full page caching on your WordPress site without sacrificing a more dynamic user experience. Dynamic content is injected into placeholders using an ajax request that is triggered after the page loads.<\/p>\n\n<p>Dynamic Components is part of the SiteBuilder suite of plugins designed to unleash the full potential of WordPress as a full Content Management System.<\/p>",
