Add a Warcraft blue post blockquote to your selected text by easily adding tags and changing font color. Version 1.1 updated image files.\nUpdate: 1.5 -  Bless  made the images transparent so they will work with any color themes now and added css so no more manualy changing font colors. The height of the images has been increased so they will work with longer posts as suggested by Leandro. You can now use [ bluepost ][ \/bluepost ] instead of the normal blockquote code, Bless\u0092s idea, this will allow you to keep quoted text already on your site from being captured in the warcraft quotes.<\/p>",
