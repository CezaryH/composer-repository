They give an immediate sense of hierarchy to your visitors and allow users to backtrack through your site to (hopefully) find more content. WordPress simplifies structuring sites how ever it seems reasonable, but it takes a bit more effort to generate breadcrumbs for all the different types of posts, and pages, and taxonomies, and archives, and ... you get the idea.<\/p>\n\n<h3>But there are already plugins for that, aren't there?<\/h3>\n\n<p>Sure! And a lot of them work really well for simple sites with simple hierarchies, but many of them fall short in one way or the other:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Want to use the new semantic <code>&#60;nav&#62;<\/code> element?<\/strong><br \/>\n  Nope sorry, all they have are <code>&#60;p&#62;",
