A signup page is just a list of stuff\nthat you can sign up for, with a space next to each item where someone can sign up.<\/p>\n\n<p>There is no validation of input, and no login is required. This is a true public signup page. However, when a\nperson signs up, that slot is frozen to the public (no further changes). Site admins can make changes to any slot,\nat any time.<\/p>",
