                "description": "<p>Another fabulous component from Jonathon Byrd. Support and documentation built right into the wordpress configurations area.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a great little plugin that will allow you to display a google map anywhere on your website. I use this on the contact pages of clients that have a brick and mortar location and are interested in customers stopping by.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can adjust the settings on this map to create a super small picture like thumbnail, or a very large map with all options turned on. Including the ability to give customers directions to your clients store!<\/p>\n\n<p>Even though this is a small plugin with a single purpose, I am providing it with as much support as I am capable of doing. If you would like me to extend its functionality, all I ask is that you buy me a beer.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please rate the components ease of use and support features, not its lack of features. Thank you!<\/p>",
