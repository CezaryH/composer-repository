Tables can contain any type of data, even formulas that will be evaluated. An additional JavaScript library can be used to add features like sorting, pagination, filtering, and more for site visitors. You can include the tables into your posts, on your pages, or in text widgets with ease. Tables can be imported and exported from\/to CSV files (e.g. from Excel), HTML files, and JSON.<\/p>\n\n<h4>More information<\/h4>\n\n<p>Please visit the plugin website at <a href=\"http:\/\/tablepress.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/tablepress.org\/<\/a> for more information.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Supporting future development<\/h4>\n\n<p>If you like the TablePress plugin, please rate and review it here in the WordPress Plugin Directory, support it with your <a href=\"http:\/\/tablepress.org\/donate\/\">donation<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/flattr.com\/thing\/783658\/TablePress\">",
