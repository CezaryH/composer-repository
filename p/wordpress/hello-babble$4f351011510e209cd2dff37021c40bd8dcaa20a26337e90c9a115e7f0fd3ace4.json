But, instead of a line from a song from a barely remembered musical, this will be an item of randomly generated Star Trek-style techno babble, with possibly millions of different combinations possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>Yes, you too can create some really impressive, scientifically baseless (yet still entertaining) techno-babble. It's useless! It's fun! It's not official endorced by Paramount!<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>For help with this plugin, or simply to comment or get in touch, please read the appropriate section in \"Other Notes\" for details.
