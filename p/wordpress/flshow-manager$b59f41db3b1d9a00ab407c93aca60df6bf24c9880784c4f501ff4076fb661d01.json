It&#8217;s often difficult, then, to explain which parts of the site can be changed within WordPress, and which are hard-coded.  This plugin is built to manage the excellent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flshow.net\/\">flShow Photo Carousel<\/a> within the comfort of the WordPress dashboard. The carousel is great for displaying the products of an eCommerce site in an attractive header, or simply for showing off your photography portfolio.<\/p>",
