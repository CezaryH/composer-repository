A screenshots is available to help clarify where this affects Wordpress.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Notes<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This plugin removes links for image files ending with the following extensions: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .tiff, .tif<\/li>\n<li>Files with other extensions - such as PDF files - will continue to work normally<\/li>\n<li>If you have existing posts and want to remove the links from images: Wordpress actually stores the links as part of the post content, so removing the links would either require looping through the posts and running a regular expression, or perhaps cheating with jQuery and removing links after the post is rendered. In short, this plugin helps remove links from images that your users post <em>from now on<\/em>, but doesn't touch your existing posts :)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/techblog.willshouse.com\/remo",
