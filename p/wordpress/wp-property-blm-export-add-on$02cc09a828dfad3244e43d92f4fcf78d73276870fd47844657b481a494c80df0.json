Specify if you want to send all the files separately, or compress them into a single zip for quicker processing.<\/li>\n<li>Support for multiple branch codes per portal in the event you are dealing with a multi-office agency.<\/li>\n<li>Incremental feeds. The plugin only includes the media that is new or has recently changed to massively reduce sending times and filesize. Can be overwritten if required<\/li>\n<li>Archiving. Store files for a configurable amount of days to act as a temporary backup. These are then automatically clean",
