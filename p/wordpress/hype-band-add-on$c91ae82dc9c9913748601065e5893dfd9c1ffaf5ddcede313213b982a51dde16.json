Rather than including all of the features that we thought pertained to bands, we moved them to an add-on built specifically for Hype.  With this add-on, you will gain access to a Tour Dates custom post type so you can add and manage your tours; the ability to display YouTube or Vimeo videos; the ability to embed a SoundCloud playlist; and the ability to display your BigCartel products.<\/p>",
