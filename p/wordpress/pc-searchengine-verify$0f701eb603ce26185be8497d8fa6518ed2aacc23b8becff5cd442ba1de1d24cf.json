One of the methods they allow you to use, is to add a meta tag to the head section of your home page.<\/p>\n\n<p>The meta tag must contain a unique identifier, provided to you in the webmaster tools area of each search engine.<\/p>\n\n<p>Once you've added the meta tag to your website's home page, the search engine will crawl your site to confirm ownership.<\/p>\n\n<p>This usually gives you access to extended information about your website, such as incoming links, referrers, traffic ..etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course you can add meta tags to your site by hand, but that would mean editing your WordPress theme files - not the best way of doing these things.<\/p>\n\n<p>With this plugin there's no editing of files, just upload, activate, and add the meta tag info on the plugin options page under your Settings menu. All done.<\/p>",
