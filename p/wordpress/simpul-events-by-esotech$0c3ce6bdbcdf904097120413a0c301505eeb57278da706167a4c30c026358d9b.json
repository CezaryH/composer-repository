The Events post type includes a custom Taxonomy \"Calendars\" so you can assign an event to multiple calendars. Adding an event allows you to choose a start date and end date using jQuery Ui's Date Picker, as well as adding your own custom link and location displayed by Google Maps.<\/p>\n\n<p>The widget allows you to customize the display of a list of events or calendars. There are many CSS classes included in the HTML to style the Widget to your needs. You can show the Calendar, list of Events, or a combination of both.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Calendars provides pop out functionality for events if desired, with the ability to include a custom size Google map of the event location as well as link to the event page, which you can customize in your own template.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.esotech.org\/plugins\/simpul\/simpul-events\/\">More Details<\/a><\/p>\n\n<h4>Planned Features<\/h4>\n\n<ul>",
