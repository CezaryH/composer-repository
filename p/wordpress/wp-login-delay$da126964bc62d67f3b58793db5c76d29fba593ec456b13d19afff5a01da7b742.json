WP Login Delay is a small plugin that offers a simple help against this.\nFor each login attempt on the system, the plugin will add a delay of one second. Although the users will not feel any difference when logging into the system, this can help again a bot that is sending thousands of requests and waits for their results.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>This plugin will not make your system highly secure, there are other security plugins that do the job better than WP Login Delay.<\/em> But installing this plugin will add one more defense to your website, and this defense should not conflict with any other defense already installed.<\/p>",
