So if you have 20 images in a post, you&#8217;ll end up with additional 21 queries. More queries means more load time for your server to response a request from browser.<\/p>\n<p>Daniy Image Manager pull a post attachments from the wp_posts and wp_postmeta ONCE when the single page is requested, then the result is cached and stored in the vacant post_content_filtered field in wp_posts table. This means, on the next call to the same single page will also pull the attachments saved data in post_content_filtered field. All we have to do is unserialize it and output to browser. No more get_posts() or get_children() queries to database.\n<\/p>",
