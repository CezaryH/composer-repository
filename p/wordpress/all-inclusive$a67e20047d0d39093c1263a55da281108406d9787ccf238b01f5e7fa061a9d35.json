Let me remind you these are already in the global object in the array $wp_query-&#62; posts. Let&#8217;s begin from creating a list of ID (number of records to which they are stored in the database).<\/p>\n\n<h4>Form the first SQL query:<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$query = \"SELECT $wpdb-&#62;posts.* FROM $wpdb-&#62;posts WHERE  $wpdb-&#62;posts.post_parent IN('21','29','30','35','38','42','46','48','49','55') AND $wpdb-&#62;posts.post_parent\nAND $wpdb-&#62;posts.post_type = 'attachment'\";<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>A normal translation is &#171;find all the child entries for entries ",
