Sometimes they come looking for something that isn't there. So, you can leave them a personalized message.<\/p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, you may be looking for ways to monetize your site: this plugin is fantastic for this, because it gives you the opportunity to display some tematic links (quite in a Adsense way, but you control it). You can send affiliate marketing links to the visitor interested in them.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is my first Wordpress plugin, so any suggestion is welcome. Please leave a comment on my weblog if you find it useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n<p>It doesn't address a single page, but all the pages that are ",
