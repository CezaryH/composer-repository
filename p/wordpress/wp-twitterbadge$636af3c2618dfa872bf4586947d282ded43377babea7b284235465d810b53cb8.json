This plugin takes the hassel out of having to manually edit the details and enter it into your theme each time you change themes.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm providing this plugin as it is since this Twitter Badge is actually written and maintained by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.go2web20.net\/twitterFollowBadge\/\">go2web20.net<\/a>. However, I will be fixing bugs that are found in the plugin and updating with updates from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.go2web20.net\/twitterFollowBadge\/\">go2web20.net<\/a>. That being said, your feedback is very important!<\/p>\n\n<p>I do not claim ownership of any part(s) of the included &#34;badge.js&#34; Javascript file as it belongs to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.go2web20.net\/twitterFollowBadge\/\">go2web20.net<\/a>.
