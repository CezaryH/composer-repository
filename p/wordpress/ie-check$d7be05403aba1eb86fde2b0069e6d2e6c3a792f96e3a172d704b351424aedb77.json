Of course everyone tries to design and implement themes that work well on all browsers, but there's always something that doesn't quite work in an older version of Internet Explorer.\nWhat this plugin does is display a message to the user informing that the version of Internet Explorer he\/she is using is old.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are some options you can change like the text, the URI of the site with browser info and an option to show or hide the dismiss button, in case you really don't want to allow the users see your site unless they have a decent browser.<\/p>\n\n<p>There's a CSS file with all the styles you can change.<\/p>",
