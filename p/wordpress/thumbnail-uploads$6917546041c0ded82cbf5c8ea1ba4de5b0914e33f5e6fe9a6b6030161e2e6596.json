It allows to replace the thumbnails that are auto generated by the default image resizer of WordPress. You can just drag your self-created thumbnails (size and look does not matter) from your desktop or any other location and replace the incorrect thumbnails which are automatically generated.<\/p>\n\n<h4>It is the easiest and quickest way to add or replace your thumbnails! You do not need any program or knowledge to access your server.<\/h4>\n\n<p>When to use this plugin?<\/p>\n\n<p>If you want your own thumbnail to be displayed in the photo galleries instead of the default created by WordPress. For example, if the thumbnail of your photo gallery does not look good or if you are not satisfied by the WordPress created thumbnail. Then you can create own thumbs (which can of course look different from the original pictures), upload and replace them with the ones already generated by the WordPress.<\/p>\n\n<p",
