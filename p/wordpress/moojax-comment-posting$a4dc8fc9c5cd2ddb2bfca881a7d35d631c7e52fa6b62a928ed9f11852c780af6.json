Developed specifically to work with the mootools framework.<\/p>\n\n<p>Should deprecate peacefully, and tested in Safari, Opera, Firefox and IE7<\/p>\n\n<p>MooTools is an ultra-light frame work with faster operation than prototype\/scriptaculous and more intuitive nomenclature than jQuery. This plugin will not work if you already use another library on your site (JQuery, scriptaculous, etc).<\/p>\n\n<p>Should you have any issues plugging this into your site please email me: <a href=\"mailto:mcp@handsandfeetdesign.com\">mcp@handsandfeetdesign.com<\/a><\/p>",
