                "description": "<p>This plugin provides similar functionality to the <a href=\"http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/sidecontent\">Drupal Side Content module<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>It enables you to define a set of widgets which are effectively placeholders. Each one is empty until you assign content\nto it when editing a page.\nThis enables you to extend the content of the page into the sidebar.<\/p>\n\n<p>Suppose, for example, you have a set of pages about people in your company. You could use a side content\nwidget to add a biography for each of them, or a photo, or to list their favourite pizza toppings.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can use the plugin without any template changes at all, but it does provide a simple API so you can test for the presence of side content widgets and adjust your templates accordingly.<\/p>\n\n<p>As of release 0.7 of the plugin, it supports the <a href=\"http:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Shortcode_API\">WP shortcode API<\/a>. There is also an extra add-on plugin which provides the same support for <a href=\"http:\/\/alexrabe.boeli",
