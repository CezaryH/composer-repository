This is a work in progress and may be a little bit messy due to me not having done much with PHP in a while and being new to wordpress.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please note that this requires javascript, if you expect visitors with javascript disabled please do NOT use this plugin!<\/p>\n\n<p>I made a couple of mistakes before when submitting such as leaving a wrong hardcoded path in the script and messing up the versioning due to not knowing how WordPress plugin indexing worked. This is now fixed and I have added a working example on my blog. Sorry for any inconvenience, please inform me if there are still issues<\/p>",
