                "description": "<p>Popular This Week is a plugin similar to Popularity Contest, but only records hits that happened in the last week. It then shows the most popular posts or pages in the last week as widget you can use in your theme.<\/p>\n\n<p>It's useful for high volume, high traffic sites where posts age quite quickly, and you do not necessarily want to direct your users to old content, but what people are reading right now. An example of the widget being used is here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nouse.co.uk\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.nouse.co.uk\/<\/a><\/p>",
